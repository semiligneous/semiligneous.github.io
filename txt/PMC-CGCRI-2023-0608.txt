I am writing this submission to bring to attention that the existing laws Constitutionally, Federally and
State before the supposed pandemic, not a pandemic in my view as the data has exposed, were
completely ignored and overturned.

How can a society operate effectively if laws are forgotten and abused at the whim of those people that
refuse to take into account common sense information and invoke their own rules. We the people know
the errors of doing so - Mayhem happens as has been demonstrated.

Adhere to the laws that are present at the time.

Prosecute those that broke the laws as expected by we the people.
