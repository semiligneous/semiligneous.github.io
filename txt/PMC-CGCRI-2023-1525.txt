My recommendations:

   •      Don't take advice from the WHO-

               They gave misleading and conflicting advice. Stick to our own pandemic plan

   •      The TGA should be disbanded-

               95% funding from the pharmaceutical companies is a conflict of interest.

               Alternative treatments for Covid 19 should never have been restricted

   •      Get rid of APHRA-

               For silencing doctors and interfering in the doctor patient relationship

               For not allowing informed consent

   •      Have a Royal Commission into the Pandemic response

               Why is the excess mortality rate still high after all the interventions, such as masking,
               lockdowns and vaccinations?
