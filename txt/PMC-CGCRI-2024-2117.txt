The following submission is written by a private mixed practice veterinarian registered in the
state of NSW, from a rural town, and outlines how the government should be responding to the
current pandemic, as well as future pandemics.


Politicians should not be able to cherry pick medical advice:

• Health advice should not be selected based on political convenience.
• CMOs should not be forced to give bad advice for political reasons.
• Policy should not be informed by scientists who give consistently incorrect or dangerous advice.


Transparent and Peer-Reviewed Decision-Making:

• Establish a transparent and peer-reviewed expert body to make decisions, leaving no room for vested
  interests.
• Conduct health decision-making in open forums to allow public scrutiny.


Legislation Against Harmful Advice:

• It should be illegal for politicians and media organisations to spread advice that will lead to death or
  disability.
• For example, promoting hand hygiene for an airborne virus, or encouraging returning to work or school
  while infectious.


Recognise Modes of Transmission:

• Until mode of transmission for a novel infection can be proven and verified, apply the precautionary
  principle and protect against airborne spread.
• Ensure adequate respiratory protection forthe population.


Enhance Quarantine Measures:

• Restricting movement is an effective form of containing the spread of a virus.
• Improve quarantine facilities and measures based on the precautionary principle.
• Construct purpose-built facilities in each capital city for effective containment.


Pandemic Elimination as a Goal:

• Emphasise the goal of pandemic elimination.
• Encourage collaboration between state jurisdictions for effective containment.


Invest in Public Health Communication:

• Promote truthful information about health risks even if it challenges political narratives.


Prioritise Health Over the Economy:

• Recognise that a healthy population is crucial for economic stability.
• Prioritise health in governance to ensure long-term economic well-being.
