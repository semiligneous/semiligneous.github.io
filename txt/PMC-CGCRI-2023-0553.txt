My personal experience with Covid.

I was encouraged to get Astra Jenica vaccine by my doctor and I immediately got a reaction,
aching limbs so much that I could not open door handles and my^Hcame and altered all our
door knobs so we could manage this simple function. I could hardly get in and out of the car and
only drove 2 Km to the shopping centre. My doctor just said take paracetamol. I sent a report to
the TGA and got an acknowledgement. The aches lasted 3 months then I returned to normal. I
have since learned that I was lucky. Some died. Our Government let us down.

These vaccines were not properly tested, we were the guinea pigs and the drug companies
made millions, and people died. I was also disappointed that the medical authorities took no
notice of the protection achieved when a person had Covid but continued strongly to push the
population to be vaccinated.

I was concerned at the economic damage that the complete closure of businesses caused and
the debt that our nation has accumulated for future generations to repay.

Covid management has been a massive Government failure and I hope a lesson has been
learned although with the UN now wanting to control all the world should another virus arise, I
have my doubts.

Thankyou.
