How was vaccination mandated in workplaces under absurd risk assessments even for organisations
where risk could not be justified?

Vaccination rates were high but many were coerced to achieve this goal, and therefore it was not an
achievement, but a shameful, disrespectful and coercive acc. They could not stop the spread of
Omicron no matter how high they got. They were redundant, both in terms of the goal achieved and
their effect to stop the virus. Check your own domestic violence policies regarding coercive control.

How were lockdowns productive, business suffered, livelihoods destroyed, the economy, Australia's
debt and now citizens pay through inflation and interest rates?

Border closures?

How did crash statistics fare during periods of lockdown? How are medical episodes in traffic related
incidents? What of the overinflated death statistics and missing portions of data? What of statistics of
death recordings - ie someone tested positive for covid but the death was a fatal car crash. Why was
mass fear and hysteria were being fuelled by media, gov, organisations, sports elite.

Where is accountability of the health ministers? They just get promoted out - defence minister etc.

Where is any accountability - WHO said do this - health ministers recommend follow WHO,
workplaces follow health ministers - health ministers never mandated anything - no one takes
accountability while the population suffers with a bizarre totalitarian regime.

Victoria?

I am opposed to the removal of our freedoms by governments in the form of mask mandates, vaccine
mandates, lockdowns, and curfews, we deserve a real COVID inquiry that will look into all aspects of
how the 'pandemic' was handled.
