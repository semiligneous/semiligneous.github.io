To Whom It May Concern:

My mother had good health, but after having been coerced into taking the cl9 poison for
travel purposes (a requirement of Jet Star), she contracted Myocarditis! She has never
smoked in her life, never had asthma and yet when she had a coughing fit and needed hospital
care in May 2023, the hospital couldn't quite pinpoint the cause!

The famous and expensive St Vincent's Hospital Sydney instead went on their COVID scam
drills and mandated masks and didn't allow her to walk outside. I have the hospital's records
to go with the representation of her case.

I want answers as to why the quality of her life is sufficiently reduced and I pray that she didn't
suffer from sudden arrhythmic death syndrome is when someone dies suddenly and
unexpectedly from a cardiac arrest, but the cause of the cardiac arrest can't be found. We will
purse Class Action on the matter.
