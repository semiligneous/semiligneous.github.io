Submission re:
Call for submissions and evidence to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry



Attenbon Prime Minster or whom it may concern

I am writing in response to the call for a royal commission into investigating
the failings, overreach and draconian measures of the government's at the
time during the Covid period some of which are stilI ongoing
Despite pzifer's early public admission that injecbons we're not tested for
transmission and did not don't people contracbng the disease, the vaccine
mandates conbnue, causing harm and death in people of all ages
The risk of hospitalisabon is now been proven, the more injecbons you have
the greater risk of hospitalisabon
There was constant surveillance and fear mongering by the health ministers on
a daily basis (at 11 am) and press every hour
Natural immunity was ignored and other treatments disregarded
The gaging and censorship of doctors was evident as people were unable to get
informed consent
Doctors were suspended for having different researched opinions on
alternabve medical treatments, each pabent is different and may require a
different approach
Silencing of doctors with threats of de registrabon by AHPRA and ATAGI
Destrucbon and banding the use of Ivermecbn
No recognibon of vaccine adverse reacbon and deaths
Increase in excess mortality
Change of the definibon of the vaccine to MRNa drug therapy
Why was^^^trying to hide the adverse effects for 75 years
Why weren't we told about the possible side effects
How masks have never been proven to stop the spread of and virus
Lockdowns only increase the risk for people becoming sick by not getting fresh
air and sunlight
The adverse affects on mental health and increase in suicide especially among
young people due to the constant fear mongering
The lack of support for the elderly who were unable to receive visitors and
attend essential health services and specialist
Children losing almost 6 months of essential education de to school closures
and lockdowns
Medical/specialist treatment not being managed therefore certainly condibons
becoming life threatening and in some cases leading to death



I am a midwife/registered nurse of over 40 years in health and have personally
been mandated out of work and am stilI unable to return to work despite the
shortages in nursing due to ongoing ineffective vaccine mandates
The emotional suffering I have endured over the forced loss of my job (which I
devoted my entire working life to) are
I felt overwhelmed and abandoned by the profession I loved. I've been
criticised and verbally abused for not wearing a mask despite having a mask
exemption. Because I was not aloud to work I lost my sense of purpose and felt
isolated, I've experienced all kinds of difficult and unexpected emotions
including self harm and anger, disbelief and profound sadness.
This pain and grief has effected my physical health, making it difficult to sleep,
eat, and or even thinking clearly
I have been seeing a mental health professional to help me deal with my
depression since I have lost my job
Because I declined the mandated injecbons I was unable to purchase essenbal
items, relying on my family to do this for me
I was excluded from family funebons unless I could prove I was triple injected
I was unable to attend a funeral of a family member
I was not allowed into a family home unless I could provide evidence of
vaccinabon
I was hospitalised following a^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^fduring a
compulsory facial mask fitting
I was almost denied a medical procedure because I was unable to wear a face
mask
I have witness fathers missing the births of their children waibng on the results
of a PCR test despite having a negative RAT test

I have witnessed people seeking a specialist, denied an appointment because
they were not vaccinated
I was not allowed into a pharmacy, shopping complex or supermarket unless I
QR coded in
 My own daughter who was coerced into taking the injections so she could
continue working and provide for her family and keep her home was allowed to
work whilst having COVID while I was unable to work despite never having
COVID

In closing I could not and will not put anything in my body that was not
correctly researched
The pharmacy companies would not disclose the side effects
My doctor was not able to give me informed consent
How could anyone trust a pharmaceutical company that was seeking a 75 year
disclosure period
