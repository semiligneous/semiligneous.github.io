10   pages? Surely a proper set out should be the basis of any genuine inquiry. I however can in one
11   way limit my submission to 3 pages by providing the attachment as part of evidence.

23   In response I lodged that day 6 August 2021 a formal complaint with the Australian Federal
24   Police followed by numerous supplements, as shown by the attachment, which all can be
25   downloaded from my blog https://www.swcribd.com/inspectorrikati which shows I exposed how
26   the Department of Health made false claims on its website, how the TGA failed proper
27   investigation, allegedly contrary to its statement on its website to rely upon the FDA (USA), and
28   the latter neither investigating what really was going on and the mere fact that R$V40 monkey
29   virus (the one that caused the harm regarding polio injections around the 1960’s underlines that
30   the ‘safe and effective” deceptive mantra was a well-planned criminal conduct to pursue the
31   “gene therapy” DEPOPULATION bioweapon mass murder upon Australians also.
32                                (being a heart patient now has also been targeted by Banyule City
33   council with their terrorism where I have been exposing the constitutional wrongdoing of the
34   Federal government, the State government and municipaFshire councils.
35   I never had any doubt that the Australian Federal Police likely would not investigate, and by
36   their failure to do so be an accomplish to the treason and terrorism engaged in by the various
37   governments. Not just Labor or Liberals!
38   Let it be clear, that the push for the World Health Organisation to now take over Australians (and
39   so the world) personal & constitutional rights is in violation of our rights enshrined in the
40   principles of the Commonwealth ofAustralia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) in which the High
41   Court of Australia itself also is involved (Consider Palmer i’ WA).

 1     I do not think the word quarantine, for instance, which is used in the sub-section of the 52nd
 2     clause, is intended to give the Commonwealth power to legislate with regard to any
 3     quarantine. That simply applies to quarantine as referring to diseases among man-kind.

 5   Let me make something very clear, that any Australian who vote because it is compulsory
 6   simply doesn’t understand what our constitution stands for. The Australian Electoral
 7   Commission charged me regarding the 2001 federal election in AEC i’ Schorel-Hlavka for
 8   FAILING TO VOTE upon which I filed and served also upon all 9 Attorney-Generals a
 9   NOTICE OF CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER challenging the constitutional validity of the
10   “compulsory part of voting. The AEC again subsequently charged me with FAILING TO VOTE
11   regarding the 2004 federal election. All along representing myself on 19 July 2006 I
12   comprehensively defeated the lot of them. I am not against any Australian to exercise the right to
13   vote, and at times I do so, but my issue is that the “compulsory” part is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
14   The constitution doesn’t provide for anything of “EMEMRGENCY” and as such any claim of
15   DECLARED EMERGENCY cannot override the constitutional rights of any Australian.
16   However, the court at times may hold that in certain circumstances a fire fighter, etc, may not be
17   held legally accountable in the circumstances prevailing. As such, the alleged “MANDATES”
18   had no legal basis and as a matter of fact the States/Territories had no constitutional powers for
19   legislative, executive an^dministradvyTowei^^^rea^e^lon^nfiorc^^JANDATES”.
20   I understand that                                                                  had isolated the
21   alleged “SARD-CoV-2” virus, this even so no one has ever proved by the Koch postulate to have
22   isolated and purified this alleged virus. Actually, the symptoms of the alleged “COVID” 19 were
23   about identical. It was merely relabelling influenza (flu) as COVID-19, and use FEAR to scare
24   the lining daylight out of people around the world with the collusion of those in the governments.
25   Former PM Scott Morrison relied upon the UNCONSTITUTIONAL “NATIONAL
26   SECURITY” as to hide the secret UNCONSTITUTIONAL arrangements with the
27   pharmaceutical companies, but our constitution doesn’t provide for this. Every contract using
28   taxpayers monies must be revealed in full, and if a company doesn’t like the disclosure then well
29   they shouldn’t do business with our governments. Ask yourself who got the commission
30   pharmaceutical companies were paying for the contracts? We are talking about tens of millions
31   of dollars! This is also why the unconstitutional “NATIONAL SECURITY” was pursued so that
32   those in government had a quick rich scheme with no accountability, even so violating s44 of the
33   constitution. Moreover Section 45 of the constitution is that any Member of Parliament engaged
34   in such conduct AUTOMATICALLY has lost the seat.

42   As I stated       is suffering from heart failure but she may outlive perhaps most of Australians
43   (or the world population) who had been jabbed with the “gene therapy” DEPOPULATION
44   bio weapon, this as experts have stated that most people jabbed will likely die within 6 years of
45   the jab! So, anyone reading this better start making their last testament before it might be too
46   late! Then we heard about the blood cloths, which I understand from the reports I quoted in my
47   writings are not blood cloths but are certain non-blood cloths due to the graphite and undisclosed
48   items in the “gene therapy” DEPOPULATION bioweapon. It means that no one ever could be
49   considered to have given “informed consent”. Anyone who really care about the health,
50   wellbeing and safety of their family and others I view would have no hesitation to demand a
51   ROYAL COMMISSION I made clear was needed some years ago.

30         I think we might, on the attempt to found this great Commonwealth, just advance one step,
31         not beyond the substance of the legislation, but beyond the form of the legislation, of the
32         different colonies, and say that there shall be embedded in the Constitution the righteous
33         principle that the Ministers of the Crown and their officials shall be liable for any
34         arbitrary act or wrong they may do, in the same way as any private person would be.
