I am alarmed at the current lack of government interest in clean air indoors.

The National COVID-19 Health Management Plan (2023) did not go far enough
in ensuring indoor air is safe for immunocompromised citizens.

For example, it states:

   1. Tf a positive COVID-19 result is received, stay home where possible, and
      if you must leave, wear a mask and avoid high-risk settings.’
   2. ‘All aged care homes should encourage staff and visitors to wear a face
      mask when indoors and in close contact with other people at a residential
      care home. ’

However, there is no mention of the type of mask recommended. Many
Australians now wear surgical masks, which merely protect the wearer from
contact with large particles (droplets and sprays). However, the Covid-19 virus
is now known to be airborne and far too tiny to be ‘filtered’ by surgical masks.
N95 masks are required to remove viruses from inhaled air. (N95 masks not
only block small particles, they also attract them with the electric interaction,
so they get stuck to the fibres.) N95 and KN95 masks were found to be 48%
more effective than surgical or cloth masks (Andrejko et al, 2022).

There is also no mention of ventilation or air cleanliness. Ventilation and the use
of HEPA air purifiers should be mandated in any building where people gather
indoors.
