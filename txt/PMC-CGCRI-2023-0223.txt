What a hopeless set of terms of reference for this inquiry.
Surely this inquiry is a whitewash. I am not fooled, nor happy. Where is the Royal
Commission to do a real job with relevant terms of reference? There is no allowance to
consider real issues including:
1. Corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts
2. Frustration of the approval process for the only Australian company to produce a real
(protein based) vaccine, and that was effective (Vaxine Pty Ltd, SA)
3. Media and politician misinformation and lies regarding the ability of approved
vaccines to block transmission
4. Significant vaccine injuries
5. Demonization, silencing, censorship and oppression of doctors who dared speak out
against the approved vaccines
6. WHO mismanagement
