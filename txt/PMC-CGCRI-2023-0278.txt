To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my profound concerns and opposition to the measures taken during the COVID-
19 pandemic, which I believe represent significant overreach by the government and health authorities.
These actions, often justified under the guise of public health, have in many ways infringed upon
individual freedoms, transparency, and the principles of scientific discourse.

    1.   Corrupt Vaccine Procurement and Secret Contracts: The lack of transparency in vaccine
         procurement processes has raised serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest and
         unethical practices. This secrecy undermines public trust and accountability.

    2.   Mask Mandates: The imposition of mask mandates, especially in outdoor and low-risk settings,
         represents an overreach of government authority. These mandates were often enforced
         without clear scientific justification, infringing upon personal freedoms and self-determination.



    3.   Lockdowns: The widespread use of lockdowns has had devastating effects on the economy,
         mental health, and societal structures, often without significantly controlling virus spread. This
         disproportionate response has caused more harm than good, violating personal liberties under
         questionable public health benefit.

    4.   Vaccine Mandates: Vaccine mandates infringe upon individual rights and bodily autonomy. The
         evolving data on vaccine efficacy and natural immunity call into question the necessity and
         justification of such overbearing government measures.



    5.   Official Misinformation: Throughout the pandemic, there have been numerous instances where
         governments and health authorities disseminated misleading or incomplete information,
         exacerbating public fear and compliance without providing a balanced understanding of the
         risks involved.

    6.   Lies in the Media Regarding Vaccine Transmission Blocking: The media, often echoing
         governmental narratives, has frequently overstated the efficacy of vaccines in preventing
         transmission, leading to misguided and unfounded public health policies.



    7.   Media Censorship: The suppression of alternative viewpoints and discussions in the media is a
         direct attack on the principles of free speech and open scientific debate. This censorship has
         hindered a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic and its challenges.

    8.   Vaccine Injuries: The apparent underreporting and downplaying of vaccine-related injuries is
         concerning. There needs to be greater transparency and acknowledgment of these risks to
         ensure informed public decision-making.



    9.   Silencing of Doctors: The actions taken against medical professionals who have questioned the
         mainstream pandemic responses or offered alternative viewpoints is deeply troubling. It
         represents a violation of scientific discourse and medical freedom.
    10. Role of AHPRA and ATAGI in Censorship and Oppression: The excessive control exerted by these
        organisations over medical professionals' opinions and practices is alarming. It undermines the
        ability of doctors to treat their patients according to their best judgment and professional
        expertise.



    11. Poor Treatment of Victims: The victims of lockdowns, vaccine mandates, and vaccine injuries
        have not been adequately supported or recognised. This neglect reflects a lack of accountability
        and compassion in addressing the consequences of these measures.

In conclusion, the response to the pandemic, in many respects, has been characterised by excessive
control, lack of transparency, and a suppression of dissent, reminiscent of an Orwellian state. It is
imperative that we re-examine these actions and policies, prioritising individual rights, transparency,
and open scientific inquiry.

Sincerely,
