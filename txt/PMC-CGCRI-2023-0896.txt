There was a lot wrong with the government's response to COVID-19.

For me the main thing was the inability of the government to prevent my daughter's mother from
weaponizing the rules to withhold my daughter from me.

The courts were seemingly not interested in helping out children or parents that didn't see each
other with in my case at least a 6 month wait before I could have an application heard so my
daughter and I could see each other again.
