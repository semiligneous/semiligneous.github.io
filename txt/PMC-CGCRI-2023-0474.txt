To The Covid Enquiry Members



I wish to request from this committee that consideration be given to recommending that a Royal
Commission be held to widen the scope of the current enquiry to ensure States are accountable for
their actions. Should States not be held accountable to a higher power, i.e. the Federal government
then how can we ensure the fundamental human rights of every Australian are upheld?

The actions of the State of Queensland have caused immeasurable harm to both myself, my husband
and my family.

I studied for 4 years to become a nurse. I started working in                 | for four years and for
th^ollowing 3 years I worked as a casual in both|            and              in two^^^^^^H
^^^Hhospitals.

When the vaccine mandates came in, I applied for a Religious Exemption which was denied. I
subsequently found out through Freedom on Information that only 3 Religious Exemptions were
granted in Queensland. Efforts to establish why these 3 religious exemptions were granted, who sat
on the committee making such decisions and what criteria were used to make these decisions were
denied to me by my employer, The Queensland Government.

I requested from my employer that I be given details of their Risk Assessment and how they
established that I was a risk to anyone in my workplace. They did not supply me with such a risk
assessment. They also did not consult with me on the vaccine mandates. I feel I have been
Discriminated against by my employer and that the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991 has been ignored.

I appealed my employer's decision by taking my case to the Queensland Industrial Relations
Commission who threw my case out say that I had not listened to a "legal and reasonable directive" I

In addition, my Employer would not allow my Registered Organisation^^^^^^^^^^^l
                                   to represent me in my QIRC proceedings, denying me the right to
my choice of representation.

I received a termination letter from the Queensland Health on
which happened to                      Even though all the TV media and other media outlets have
reported that the vaccines mandates have been dropped in Queensland, Queensland Health have
incorporated mandatory vaccinations in their new conditions of employment. This means that
myself and many others who have chosen not to be vaccinated with the Covid injection are
permanently being discriminated with regard to employment prospects and most employers have
followed the lead of the Queensland Government and have changed their conditions of employment
to requiring employees be vaccinated to work at their respected places of employment. I am a
nurse and for the past two years have been unable to find work due to not being vaccinated. I have
had Covid twice (very mildly) which means I have natural antibodies and yet natural immunity has
not been taken into account by Queensland Health.



Myself and my family suffered under Apartheid for 4 decades and it is really hurtful to think that
after all that suffering I am now being discriminated against simply because I do not want an
injection as it goes against my conscience and religious beliefs. We have suffered immense anxiety,
stress and hardship due to the decisions of the state government and the Federal government not
standing up for the individual rights of Australians to choose what goes into their bodies. Because I
was suspended without pay for two years by Queensland Heath and because I have been unable to
get a job we had to sell our family home in^^^^Hand were forced to move out to a regional area
due to the severe financial restraints we founds ourselves in because of the mandates.
owned up last year to nearly taking his life twice, due to the stress and anxiety we experienced under
the mandates. We were bullied, villifed and un-friended by friends and family and feel this
experience has traumatised us.
In 2022 I was denied ai^^^Jand ^Hby our local hospital after sufferin^^^^^^^^^^^^^ over
the period of one month. The Doctor advised me in ED that he was not sure if if could get these
diagnostics as I was unvaccinated; he went of to discuss this with his manager and came back to
confirm that he was advised that I could not get the requirec^^^ and^Jand that I would have to
go out to a community facility which I did.

Because we are unvaccinated my^^^^f and I are struggling to find sufficient work. In addition,
because Queensland Health has terminated my employment through "Dismissal" I have a black mark
against my name. This have severely impacted my ability to find work. Despite this I have applied
for numerous job is caring, etc but have only been able to find a little casual work over the past year.

At the moment I have a casua^^^^^^^^^Bjob, with an unvaccinated friend.                               has
no work. He is not allowed to volunteer or attend the local Men's shed because he is not
vaccinated. We are becoming impoverished because we are unable to find sufficient work. How
can this happen is Australia????

Due to the Federal Government handing over all decisions to the National Government and the
States, ordinary Australians have been unable to seek fair and equal treatment in this regard. The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights states clearly that all people the right to work in just and
favourable conditions, that they are endowed with reason and conscience, the rights and freedoms
include the right to religion (Article 6). In addition, Article 7 states that all are equal before the law
and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection against any discriminination.

I was denied the right to visit my^^Jin a nursing home when other citizens were allowed, due to
my not being vaccinated despite their being no evidence put forward by the State Government that I
was a risk to my^^^^ar her fellow residents. The so called science in this regard was never
provided to the citizens of this country.

We were denied entry to restaurants, cafe's, etc. On a short holiday in                  husband
and I were denied access to two local bakeries and the council public public toilets in^^^^^
Queensland because we weren't vaccinated and couldn't scan in. Surely this type of discrimination
can never be allowed to happen again?

This whole experience has been traumatising to both my^^^^^Hand myself who feel like we are
once again second class citizens. We have cried so many tears and feel very despondent about our
future. Our faith in God alone, has sustained us despite the many discriminations we have suffered
over the past three years.



The Federal Government must not negate their authority to the state governments to ensure that
this on-going discrimination against those who are unvaccinated stops and never happens again.
May God grant our leaders compassion for all their fellow citizens, vaccinated and unvaccinated, and
may he give them wisdom to govern the country fairly and equitably.
