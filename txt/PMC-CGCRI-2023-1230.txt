     The Problem:
     The Department of Health and Aged Care did not have the infrastructure and capacity to convene cross sector,
     multidiscipline engagement and rapidly provide reliable COVID-19 treatment guidance to clinicians.
     The National Clinical Evidence Taskforce stepped into that gap.


    The National Clinical Evidence Taskforce created the world’s first                      The multidisciplinary guidelines played a critical role in
    evidence-based living COVID-19 treatment guidelines. The living                          providing clinical confidence to Australian clinicians and

    COVID-19 guidelines provided a calm voice in the chaos and                              decision makers throughout the pandemic.

    pies or delayed implementation of effective therapies.

       RECOMMENDATIONS
       The Commonwealth Government must provide funding for up-to-date, multidisciplinary
       clinical guidelines for routine clinical practice and in emergencies. This can be achieved by
       the funding of ALEC and its 64-members including ALL the major clinical organisations
       and strong consumer representation. To:

                 Ensure a dedicated and sustainable model for developing and maintaining evidence-based
                 clinical guidelines both routinely, and during crises.

                 Maintain the capacity and convening power of bringing a combination of clinical and research
                 experts together to solve complex problems swiftly without comprising scientific rigour

                 Engage with key stakeholders and organisations across the health sector with a multi-disci­
                 plinary but unified approach; having everyone in the same initiative and onboard with the
                 approach

        Q        Maintain credible, transparent, independent and rigorous scientific methods and processes
                 for the development of clinical guidance
