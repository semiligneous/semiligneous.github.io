Government works for the people of Australia. AHPRA and the Government
need consultation with the people who have direct contact with their patients
and customers, rather than a blanket rule that sounds like it came from the
dystopian 1984 novel.

AMPS supports:

    •   The primacy of the doctor/patient relationship, with Government
        bureaucrats being removed from the surgery room.
    •   Making it easier for doctors to speak out publicly. Doctors are currently
        gagged by AHPRA.
    •   The removal of AHPRA from monitoring doctors on social media and
        voicing their medical opinions.
    •      Resisting Government Coercion.
    •      The ability to speak out about refugee health without fear of de-registration.
    •      Resisting Government mandates.
    •   Resisting Government agencies running roughshod over doctors in what
        they can prescribe and recommend.

AMPS remains fully committed to defending your right to treat patients as you see
fit and respects the enormous amount of medical training undergone to achieve this
right. AHPRA and Government must be drastically limited in this space.

The government formed a plan of masks, lockdowns and vaccinations without due process. Many
experts had solutions that didn't require the draconian response of the government, these
professionals were cut out of the plan and pilloried for their views.

That is why this bill for mis- and disinformation is dangerous. Government did not consult with a
wide variety of sources including the public, and dismissed those with other responses in matters
that effected the whole population.

The government gave their sector pay rises, while others suffered from their covid response.
