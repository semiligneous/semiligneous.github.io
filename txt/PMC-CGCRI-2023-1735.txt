Thank you for allowing me the chance to contribute my thoughts on this Inquiry and on the
establishment of the Australian Centre for Disease Control. As someone who is actively
retraining toward a Health Security career, I am thrilled about the inception of the new CDC.

Recent studies—notably a 2022 paper by Bernstein—highlight the vital importance of investing
in pandemic prevention. The research convincingly argues that, even under conservative
estimates and without factoring in the potential of emerging technologies, substantial investment
in preventing pandemics is not only necessary but economically sensible. The paper
underscores the economic feasibility and necessity of proactively addressing pandemic threats.

In this context, the new Australian Centre for Disease Control should prioritize initiatives aimed
at preventing the emergence of novel pathogens. The recent experience with COVID-19, which
was anticipated by medical experts globally, is a stark reminder of the continuous threat posed
by infectious diseases. The risk effacing even more severe pandemics in the future is real and
imminent. Therefore, it is critical that the Australian CDC not only focuses on immediate health
protection but also invests in measures to anticipate, prevent, and if necessary, contain novel
infectious diseases effectively.

This submission focuses on two issues that I believe should be high among the Australian
CDC’s priorities: improving indoor air quality and preventing zoonotic spillover events.

Firstly, the Australian government must establish explicit, robust codes of practice and
standards for Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), coupled with stringent regulations for environments
deemed high-risk. Annually, countless Australians suffer illnesses due to airborne pathogens in
indoor spaces, with our most susceptible populations, including the elderly and
immunocompromised, facing heightened risk. Enhanced IAQ controls would not only fortify our
defenses against current and future pandemics but also mitigate health issues stemming from
other airborne threats such as indoor smog, hazardous materials, non-pandemic respiratory
ailments, and a spectrum of airborne health risks.

Despite the fact that Australians spend upwards of S , % of their time indoors, the Australian
Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water reveals a glaring lack of
specific IAQ controls, save for the minimal guidelines set forth by Work Safe Australia. In the
absence of national standards and codes delineating minimum performance criteria for infection
control, I fear we are at risk of defaulting to subpar measures that offer scant protection against
pathogens.

The institution of clear, rigorous IAQ codes and standards in Australia would establish
unambiguous metrics and targets for air quality, aiming to curtail pathogen transmission. Absent
these standards, there is a looming concern that manufacturers and innovators might develop
products insufficient in purifying indoor air to levels that significantly diminish pathogen spread.
Standards grounded in the latest scientific insights into respiratory disease, air filtration,
sanitation, public health, and behavioral science would forge the ideal regulatory landscape,
ensuring the availability of effective IAQ interventions for the Australian populace. Moreover,
explicit guidelines are crucial for high-risk settings such as aged care facilities, hospitals, and
other healthcare environments, where airborne infections pose a dire threat.

The Lancet COVID-19 Commission Task Force's proposal of Non-infectious Air Delivery Rates
(NADR) provides tangible goals for ventilation and filtration that defend against infectious
disease transmission. While scientific debate persists over the optimum metrics and targets,
there is a consensus that current practices are inadequate. I urge the Inquiry to review the Task
Force's report for a deeper understanding of the factors involved in setting efficacious IAQ
codes and standards.

The Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB) could incorporate these standards into the
National Construction Code, drawing expertise from the Australian Commission on Safety and
Quality in Health Care, the Australasian Health Infrastructure Alliance (AHIA), and the ABCB's
existing work on IAQ. The ASH RAE Sts ard z         on the Control of Infectious Aerosols could
also be instrumental in shaping these standards.

Secondly, research indicates that the probability of zoonotic pandemics is higher and increasing
more than previously assumed. Key factors such as land use change, climate change, and the
intricacies of global travel and trade are recognized catalysts for the emergence of novel
pathogens. While not all of these elements can be halted, the Inquiry should propose feasible
domestic interventions and advocate for international strategies that mirror these efforts.

For instance, land use alterations are a significant contributor to disease transmission from
animals to humans. An illustrative case is the urban expansion in Queensland, which has led to
nutritional stress and fragmentation of flying fox habitats, subsequently causing the spillover of
Hendra virus into horses and humans.

Additionally, the movement of live animals, whether through legitimate (e.g., live animal exports)
or illicit means (such as smuggling), poses risks for disease spread. Notably, coronaviruses
found in pangolins seized in the illegal wildlife trade in Vietnam have been traced back to
Yunnan and Guangxi, China - regions where bats known to harbor SARS-related coronaviruses
akin to SARS-CoV-2 are found.

The interplay between climate change and anthropogenic land use intensifies spillover risks.
Currently, an estimated 10,000 virus species capable of infecting humans are circulating in wild
mammals, largely unnoticed. Alterations in climate and land use are expected to facilitate viral
exchanges among previously isolated species. By 2070, it is projected that there will be 300,000
novel animal pair encounters globally, effectively doubling the chances for a virus to cross
species barriers.

The Inquiry is positioned to recommend that Australia, through both national and jurisdictional
biosecurity strategies, implement practical interventions addressing these trends and their
associated risks.
Moreover, while aiding foreign governments may fall outside this Inquiry's direct mandate,
proposing international policies that protect Australians globally is pertinent. In this light, the
Inquiry should explore recommendations that leverage Australia's international influence to
advocate for comprehensive global pandemic prevention strategies.

Given our close ties with the Asia-Pacific region, where four out of nine pandemics since 1900
have originated, regional capacity building emerges as a vital aspect of global public health. The
Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security is already making significant strides in this area. The
Inquiry should consider how to expand and focus this entity's efforts on pandemic prevention,
potentially including projects that address risks associated with land use change, trade, travel,
and climate change. Additionally, exploring how this Inquiry's innovative pandemic prevention
recommendations could be disseminated regionally would be beneficial.

Australia can also enhance its role in international leadership. As a member of the International
Experts Group of Biosafety and Biosecurity Regulators and an advocate for chemical and
biological weapons security, including through the Australia Group, we have a foundation to
build upon. Actions could include:
    • Adhering to the Global Health Security Index’s 2021 report recommendation by
        reporting to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on human cases of zoonotic
        diseases, establishing a critical global norm.
    • The Foreign Minister could consider incorporating in free trade agreements with
        animal-related clauses a “national treatment” obligation, compelling trading partners to
        adopt or exceed standards and practices that prevent zoonoses. This approach would
        not only elevate best practices in Australia but also encourage our trading partners to
        adopt similar standards, enhancing safety both domestically and globally.

In conclusion, I believe pandemics are one of the most important issues facing the world. This
Inquiry should carefully consider how future pandemics could start and ensure it makes specific
recommendations to reduce their likelihood. These should include improving indoor air quality
and preventing zoonotic spillover events-the most common starting point for global pandemics.
