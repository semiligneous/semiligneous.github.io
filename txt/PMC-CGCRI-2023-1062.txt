                        Covid-19 response inquiry submission - December 2023

I am a teacher who worked throughout 2020 and observed first-hand the distress that the
lockdowns and mandates created for children, parents and staff.

Any action is only as good as the negative effects that it produces. There were an abundance of
negative effects.

The negative effects of the Covid-19 policy are many, and supported by data not listed here but
easily found if it hasn't been purposely hidden (a lot was hidden including postponing and hiding
statistics, that should be on the Bureau of Statistics website, because they didn't fit the narrative).

Lockdowns and mandates were very damaging and did more harm than good. (Just compare the
outcomes of our mandated locked downs to the voluntary lock down of Sweden.)

    -        30% increase in domestic violence during lockdowns
    -        Ongoing social/health/general phobias in children, adults and vulnerable people
    -        Financial disaster for some people and families from which they will never recover
    -        Loss of businesses and jobs
    -        Increase in major personal debt
    -        Increase in homelessness and people living out of their cars
    -        People dying in nursing homes without seeing loved ones (and general neglect)
    -        Loss of marriages and family structures
    -        Major increase in vaccine related deaths.
    -        Restrictions that erode democracy and place more power with corporations.
    -        Fewer family businesses and more corporate run systems.
    -        Censorship over what you could say
    -    Loss of freedom. The price of losing freedom of speech, and freedom in general, is always
         too high a price to pay.



Solution for any future pandemic

    1.   Voluntary lockdown. If you feel vulnerable or afraid, stay home. If you don't, continue on as
         normal. It worked in Sweden.
    2.   If you feel vulnerable, you have the option of vaccines. If you don't want to take it, don't. If
         the vaccines work, you don't need to have others vaccinated to make your vaccine work. If
         they don't work (as had been demonstrated) then don't mandate them. Always choice.
    3.   Respect freedom. Allow people to make their own choices. Less government results in less
         loss, greater finances, a better country and happier people.
    4.        Follow the money and you will find the answers. It will be an inconvenient truth.



Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope you read it with an open mind.
