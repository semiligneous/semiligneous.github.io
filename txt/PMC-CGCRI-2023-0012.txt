A call for submissions and evidence to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Dear Sir/Madam

Thank you for your invitation to submit my thoughts in relation to the Government’s handling on the
Covid pandemic.

My submission constitutes this covering letter and introduction, plus four papers that 1 have prepared
and which are available online at the following addresses:

My submission addresses just one component of what was, and remains, a complex issue.

My submission concerns the use of the pandemic as a major source of revenue largely by a collection
of non-profit organisations. The group, which in this submission shall be labelled the ‘feminist lobby’
appeared to obtain many millions of dollars from the Australian federal and state governments. Their
prime reason for seeking these grants or allocations was to address what they claimed would be a
major jump in the incidence of domestic violence. It is my view that this ‘epidemic’ (or whatever
related term one wishes to use), largely failed to occur.

Just as^^^^and other organisations have been asked to return a portion of the grants that they
received, then so too should most (if not all) of the many organisations that received funds to address
domestic violence and related matters.

Worryingly, this situation was not a one-off and raises broader issues in relation to conditions that are
(or should be) attached to all government grants. These conditions should very clearly set out the
purpose of the grant including independently-sourced proof that supports the stated reason for the
project, details regarding who will be spending the money, and how the effectiveness of the grant is to
be measured and a report later be submitted to the relevant government minister.

I appreciate that this cover letter is very brief, but I assure you that further details are provided in the
four listed files.
