How dare the Commonwealth Government allow the State Governments to impose such
draconian rules upon every day Australians?

The Commonwealth allowed freedom of choice, human rights and critical thinking to be
ignored, and allowed State Government to impose lockdowns and force employees from
certain organisations to receive untested, and unsafe vaccinations or lose their jobs.

I am a state government employee                     The Commonwealth allowed my employer
to Direct me to take the vaccine, or face dismissal.

I chose my health, and exercised my right free choice. I have been suspended without pay
for two years and am facing dismissal.

Nothing short of a Royal Commission into these atrocities will suffice.

Where is my financial support? I did nothing wrong. I exercised my human right not to be
forced into medical treatment, and I have been treated like a criminal.


I call for a Royal Commission into the State and Federal handling of COVID 19 in Australia.
