Points for consideration during the COVID-19 Response Inquiry:

   •   The wasteful spending of the government in purchasing hundreds of millions of doses of
       vaccines - far more than they needed and of which over half were never used and disposed
       of. And not being transparent about the details of the contracts involved in those purchases.
   •   The refusal of the government to pass anti-discrimination legislation to protect employees
       from being terminated on the basis of their vaccination status.
   •   The pathetic treatment of vaccine injured in terms of refusing to acknowledge their injuries
       and offer treatment/compensation due to the deliberately narrow nature of the Federal
       Scheme which is completely inadequate.
   •   The government's deliberate attempt to mislead the population by selectively
       banning/shutting down social media discussions/publications/media which did not suit their
       agenda, by labelling them 'misinformation' - including published medical studies and
       data/opinions from medical experts which we now know to be true.
   •   The government's lack of intervention to protect medical experts from losing their medical
       licences for voicing their medical opinion/advice if it did not agree with the government's
       opinion.
   •   The inaccurate/misleading method of compiling statistics for 'Covid deaths' and 'vaccine
       injuries'- by choosing definitions/methods for these terms which deliberately
       inflated/deflated actual numbers so that the government could manipulate public opinion on
       the pandemic and the response program.
