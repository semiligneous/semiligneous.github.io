   Submission and evidence to
    the COVID-19 Response
            Inquiry
Government overreach was unprecedented during covid. When studies came out
showing that the medical modelling was wrong, natural immunity was the best
option and that the control measures in place were ineffective, instead of taking a
common sense approach government officials doubled down.
This caused a huge amount of pain and suffering for so many - suicide, mental
health issues, loss of livelihoods and economic problems.
When the vaccines were proven to be neither safe nor effective (not surprisingly
since they only had emergency approval and no long term safety data), mandates
which should never have been in place anyway were not removed for a
considerable time.

If there was ever a need for accountability and a Royal Commission it is now!

Below is evidence links to my above statement. There is so many more studies
and links:

Vaccines
Safety
The TGA figures show that there are now over 100% more deaths recorded in the
first year since the launch of the Covid-19 vaccines in December 2020, than during
the entire 30-year history of recording deaths following EVERY TYPE of vaccine
combined since it was established.

Young people had worse reactions to the Vaccines than covid

For boys 12-15 without medical co-morbidities receiving their second mRNA
vaccination dose, the rate of CAE is 3.7 to 6.1 times higher
For boys 16-17 without medical co-morbidities, the rate of CAE is currently 2.1 to
3.5 times higher

No long term Safety data. Pfizer only monitored the mice up until 28 days.
Why? Why would we allow our people to be the trial whilst claiming it to be
safe?

Can Pfizer be trusted?
They do hold the world record for the largest fine -1.3B - for deceiving their
customers with intentionally wrong information on unsafe products. So why would
our government do deals with them?

No scientific consensus
3100 Doctors and scientists declare rights to treat patients individually, instead of
enforcing one treatment. I.e allow for Ivermectin and other alternatives, and not
force vaccines.

Are there any safe alternatives?
Ivermectin studies
There have been 96 studies done, 81 of them peer reviewed (at the time of this
link) and show extraordinary results as both a prophylaxis and cure. It is cheap,
safe and effective. Vaccines are none of these. There is no need at all for a
vaccine, yet that is what is being effectively mandated. The question needs to be
asked why? And why has a medicine that has been on the WHO’s safest medicine
list for 30 years being restricted and doctors being threatened to lose their licence
if they prescribed this multipurpose drug?
