Governance

Governance would normally include a reflection of proper leadership in demonstrating cherished community
values. What governments have done at both State and Federal level is undermine community valuing of individual
freedoms, choice, and respect for most institutions that were formerly held in high esteem (including governments,
health professionals, education, and the media), as well as devaluing breadth of discussion and views.

Ultimately, it is the government's responsibility to uphold values consistent with those our country has previously
long cherished, rather than being influenced or taken over by a one-eyed political narrative more reminiscent of
communist or Islamic regimes.

Key health response measures

Advice is what is expected and valued, together with evidence, for adults to be able to make choices based on
information. Choices made can then be truly informed consent (OR withheld consent, which should also be
acceptable) for both themselves and all their non-adult children (a 14-17 yo needs to remain under parental
responsibiltiy in this, as is the case in non-medical areas).

Broader health supports for people impacted by COVID-19 and/or lockdowns

Lockdowns have no place in a liberal democracy. Advice may be presented for stay-at-home options, but no
lockdowns, which breach essential freedoms and make a mockery of our values.

International policies to support Australians

If international policies from, for example, the W.H.O. are inconsistent with fundamental Australian values, then
such international policies ought to be rejected.

Support for industry and businesses

There is little need for this where government intervention has not intruded itself on diminishing its function.

Financial support for individuals

Likewise. Of course, where an individual becomes ill, provision needs to be in place to support them, irrespective of
the cause of illness (whether cancer, influenza, or accidents).
