Submission to Commonwealth Government COVIC-19 Response Inquiry

I call for a Royal Commission in the pandemic response at state and federal levels.

Abandoning the already established protocols from a previous government was a decision that
needs to be clarified and made public. Mandating vaccinations and lockdowns and politicising the
police force needs to be investigated and repudiated.

Only the truth will set us free.

Do not set up a whitewashing "inquiry" panel that is run by the same people who orchestrated this
governance debacle.
