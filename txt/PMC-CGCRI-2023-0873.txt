I lost my Payroll Management job in Hospitality after 16yrs of employment after refusing to take the
experimental COVID vaccine which has since been shown to be ineffective in both preventing and
transmitting the virus.

The vaccine mandates and restrictions placed on the un-vaccinated were a human rights violation.
Governments must be held accountable for these violations at the behest of un-elected WHO
officials and Pharmaceutical companies both of who are indemnity free when it comes to the
adverse physical, emotional & financial effects from lockdowns & vaccine mandates.

Censorship and threats of "spreading misinformation" against those in the medical and scientific
fields who had questions and concerns about this experimental MRNA vaccine and lockdown/mask
requirements being effective but possibly harmful to otherwise healthy individuals who COVID
posed a reduced risk.

Individual sovereignty must never be violated when it comes to health, freedom of speech and
travel. Governments must remember they answer to the public not the other way around.
