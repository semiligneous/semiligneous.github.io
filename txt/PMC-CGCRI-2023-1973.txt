To whom it may concern,

I am a 42 year old mother of two children living in Sydney. Prior to Covid and Pfizer vaccines
I was a healthy, fit, active, social and generally successful person. Over the past two and a
half years I have gone through innumerable doctors appointments, medications and pain
with the hope of regaining my former life.

There needs to be a better collective effort by the government to bring together the medical
community and help find solutions. There is a lack of understanding of this illness and how it
is impacting people’s lives. Right now there is no cure. Some of us have gotten ill from
vaccines that were mandated by the government and our companies.

I am told that I have ‘Covid induced cardiac immune response’. Through my twenties and
thirties I competed in sports at an elite level. I flew around the world with my job and had an
exciting career ahead of me. For over a year now I have been off work with Cardiac pain,
Brain fog and autonomic Dysfunction. I have sought the advice of many doctors in Sydney
and around the world in hope of finding a solution.

This has deeply impacted my relationship with my family. As the tiredness and pain make it
hard to be a good partner and parent. The uncertainty around my health and future gnaws
away at me on a daily basis.

The heart issues began within days of the first vaccine. I have had three vaccines and in
each case I was progressively worse. At the time no one made the link. However a Cardiac
MRI in August 2022 picked up Pericarditis. I did not have covid when the initial heart pains
occurred, only the vaccine. Post covid I started to get sharper stabbing pains as well which I
am not told is microvascular spasms. The autonomic dysfunction also came post covid.

There are a huge number of people suffering with long covid and medical complications as a
result of the vaccine. However it is very difficult to get professional advice and support on
this. I was referred to a long covid clinic in st Vincents and never heard back. I am told that
they are overwhelmed when I make contact. I was also referred to clinic nineteen who have
a six month waiting list for a consultation. There is a total lack of support in NSW and
Australia wider from what I understand. Yet a huge number of people are suffering.

This article
https://www.nvtimes.com/interactive/2023/12/14/opinion/mv-life-with-lonq-covid.html by the
New York Times gives a good insight into the impact for some. The symptoms of those
suffering are endless and relentless. I have spent tens of thousands of dollars and would
average 8 medical appointments a week all in the hope of trying to find some answers to
this. It is a debilitating disorder that is underfunded and needs to be addressed.

Also questions need to be raised around why the vaccine was approved and how it was
regulated. By the time I got my second dose guidance was available in multiple countries
that would have meant I did not get a second dose. This could have meant a very different
outcome for me.
It is my hope that in time I will recover and be able to enjoy the time I have with children. Run
with them in the park, race them in a pool and get through a full day as normal.

Thank you for your consideration,

Jessica
