Concerns Regarding the COVID-19 Response in Australia

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my comprehensive concerns regarding
various aspects of the COVID-19 response in Australia. While acknowledging the complexities
involved in managing a global pandemic, I believe it is essential to address certain issues that have
arisen during the course of these efforts.

As a fit and active young professional, I felt the profound impact of the stringent measures imposed
by State Governments. Travel restrictions and the absence of a vaccine passport limited my ability
to stay or dine in certain places for work. The persistent uncertainty surrounding major life events,
such as attending my best friend's wedding, coupled with the fear of potential job loss, added a layer
of stress that lingered for many months. Confronted with uncertainties and concerns regarding the
risks associated with mRNA vaccinations, I made a personal decision to refrain from getting
vaccinated. I remained open to receiving a protein-based vaccine, such as Covax-19, which was in
development in Adelaide. As subsequent mRNA vaccine booster shots were introduced, my
conviction in maintaining this choice only strengthened.

Hearing stories from friends who ended up in the hospital or suffered adverse effects from the
mRNA vaccinations, rather than from CO VID itself, prompted me to question the narrative. The
disparity in government payouts, where some individuals received more from these benefits than
from their regular employment, the use of face masks, and PCR tests raised significant concerns for
me.

The prevailing atmosphere seemed characterised by panic rather than common sense. The health
measures felt dogmatic, and the advertisement was reminiscent of propaganda posters from World
War II urging enlistment. Unfortunately, scientific discourse and rational conversations appeared to
be conspicuously absent from the narrative. Sadly, the alternative views that did make it into the
public light were derogatorily dismissed or grouped as conspiracy theory.

Concerns

Overuse of Lockdowns and Economic Impact:
The prolonged use of lockdowns has had a detrimental impact on the Australian economy,
particularly affecting businesses forced to close. Striking a balance between public health and
economic stability is crucial for the nation's overall well-being.

Abuse of Government Payments:
Reports of the misuse of government payments highlight the need for stringent measures to ensure
financial assistance reaches those in genuine need and prevents unnecessary costs to the country.

Pressures on Vaccination:
The pressure exerted by media, local government, and employers on individuals to receive the
COVID-19 vaccine has raised concerns. Respect for individual choices is vital for fostering a
cooperative and informed public response.

Communication on Vaccine Injuries:
Transparent communication regarding vaccine injuries is essential for building public trust.
Addressing concerns and providing adequate information will contribute to a more informed and
cooperative public response.
Fair Opportunities for Local Vaccine Providers:
Ensuring fair opportunities for local vaccine providers is crucial for an inclusive and efficient
vaccination distribution process, promoting competition and contributing to the overall healthcare
effort.


Medical Approaches Beyond Vaccination:
The exclusive focus on vaccination, to the detriment of exploring other medical approaches such as
ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, is disappointing. Recognising the known risks of these
medications compared to a new vaccine is essential for a comprehensive understanding of potential
treatment options for COVID-19.

Use of Face Masks:
The promotion and enforcement of face masks, despite evidence of their limited effectiveness in
preventing transmission, have raised concerns. The negative impact on the emotional well-being
and development of both children and adults, coupled with the adverse environmental effects of
disposable masks, necessitates a reevaluation of the widespread use of face masks. The
environmental impact, including increased waste and pollution from discarded masks, underscores
the importance of considering alternative measures that balance public health and environmental
sustainability.

PCR Test Limitations:
It is important to recognise the limitations of the PCR test, which was not originally designed to
diagnose CO VID-19 or any virus. The test does not inherently indicate an individual's sickness.

Vaccine Passports and Travel Restrictions:
The implementation of vaccine passports preventing non-vaccinated individuals from travelling
raises concerns. Since the primary purpose of vaccination is to prevent individuals from contracting
COVID-19, restricting the travel of non-vaccinated individuals seems contradictory and warrants a
reevaluation of these measures.

Solutions

Avoid Imposing Lockdowns: Adopt a targeted approach to restrictions based on specific risk
factors, avoiding blanket lockdowns that negatively impact the economy.

Reevaluate Additional Payments: Scrutinise and revise the criteria for government payments to
ensure judicious allocation, preventing misuse and unnecessary financial burden.

Oppose Vaccine Mandates: Avoid implementing mandates for COVID-19 vaccination, respecting
individual autonomy and choices.

Empower Doctors to Exercise Professional Judgement: Allow healthcare professionals the
freedom to explore and apply known drugs, like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, in their
treatment plans, enabling them to assess the risk-benefit ratio independently.

Prevent Discrimination Based on Vaccination Status: Establish policies that do not discriminate
between individuals based on their vaccination status, fostering inclusivity and respect for personal
choices.

Promote Individual Responsibility: Encourage individuals to stay home when feeling unwell and
practice self-isolation as responsible measures to prevent the spread of illnesses.
Discourage Widespread Use of Face Masks: Reevaluate the widespread use of face masks,
considering evidence on their efficacy, and discourage their use unless in specific high-risk
situations.

Minimise Reliance on PCR Testing: Reduce reliance on PCR testing as the sole determinant for
COVID test (or other viruses), recognising its limitations and exploring alternative testing methods.

Prioritise Local Vaccine Manufacturers: Give preference to local vaccine manufacturers to
support domestic industries and enhance the efficiency and inclusivity of the vaccination
distribution process.

These solutions aim to strike a balance between public health concerns and individual freedoms,
fostering a more nuanced and practical approach to addressing the challenges posed by the ongoing
pandemic.

In conclusion, I appreciate the government's dedication to managing the CO VID-19 crisis.
However, addressing these comprehensive concerns will contribute to a more balanced, effective,
and science-driven response that considers multiple medical approaches and respects individual
choices.

Thank you for your attention to these matters, and I trust that the ongoing response efforts will
incorporate these considerations for the benefit of the Australian people.
