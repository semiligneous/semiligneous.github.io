We Australians know that this inquiry is a sham. It is window dressing.

We're smart enough to know what this really is.

Just like the current inquiry in the UK, we will get the answers to the questions no one was
interested in asking. The questions we want answered won't be voiced.

We will get trivia dressed up as insights and the real answers we seek will never see the light
of day.

We need an in-depth exploration of
1      Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts

2      Vaccine mandates
3      Vaccine injuries
4      Mask mandates and lockdowns

5      Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
       infection and transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gaslighting of the
       injured

6      The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable harm of the
       vaccine and their action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical Profession.
7      Who decided to do the opposite of the 2019 Australian Health Management Plan for
       Pandemic Influenza, which prophetically described why all of the actions the
       Government did take would not work and would cause hardship?

We need answers, not a whitewash.

We Australians expect our representatives to get serious and propose a Royal Commission
into every aspect of the COVID response - not the weak vehicle that is being offered.
