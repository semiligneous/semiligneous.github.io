     What impacted me the most personally, was knowing my^^^^ied alone in a nursing
     home and the only time the family was able to see him was at the final stages when he was
     unconscious. Also I was not able to visit and check on my elderly ^^^^through this period
     due to the 5km restriction from my residence.
     I knew of many people that were coerced against their will to take an experimental vaccine
     or risk losing their job. I also know many people injured and even hospitalised from the
     vaccine.

     So what results do we have from the pandemic response?
     1/ we have a dramatic increase in covid deaths coincidentally in line with mass vaccination
        Mid-2021
     2/ dramatic increase in all-cause mortality from same time line
     I have uploaded 3 files to support these 2 claims

     At the start of the pandemic response it was about recommendations and prochoice then it
     moved very quickly into unnecessary full on medical tyranny.
     If you genuinely want to make improvements to Australia's preparedness for future
     pandemics we need an investigation into how the Covid pandemic response was nefariously
     hijacked, so I personally request a full royal commission on these key points to start with.

1. Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts
2. Vaccine mandates
3. Vaccine injuries
4. Mask mandates and lockdowns
5. Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block infection
   and transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gas lighting of the injured
6. The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety , their silence on undeniable harm of the vaccine
   and their action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical Profession.
