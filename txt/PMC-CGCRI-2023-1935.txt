                   Covid-19 Inquiry Submission

   • A Covid-19 Response Inquiry is totally unacceptable - only a Royal Commission can
     properly look into and assess the the gross negligence from Federal and State govts,
     unelected health bureaucrats and so-called health experts in managing the response over the
     last 3 years... including, but not limited to...
   •     Untested quarantining of healthy people proven unnecessay and absurd
   •     Mask mandates ineffective
   •     Lockdowns ineffective
   •     PCR Test found to be fraudulent, conseqently banned in numerous countries
   •     The doctoring of covid death statistics (dying with, not from covid, multiple comorbidities)
   •     Ventilators & Remdesivir negligently causing countless deaths
   •     Lies about vaccine preventing infection and transmission
   •     Lies about Ivermectin, HCQ, Zinc & Vit D
   •     Lies about the efficacy of the vaccines
   •     Lies about the safety of the vaccines
   •     lied to try and hide their data for 75 years
   •     They lied to hide the extent of the vaccine injuries
   • They lied by even calling the shots ‘vaccines’ - even the original definition has been
     changed (Pandemic also)
   •     Origins of Covid suppressed/censored, now admitted to be true
   •     They lied about the need for "vaccine passports"
   •     Violations of human rights and Nuremberg code
   •     They lied about the rates of myocarditis
   •     12 - 20% Excess deaths here and throughout the world being ignored by govts

   • I was unlawfully terminated (1st time in my life) by my previous employer for not taking a
     now overwhelmingly proven unsafe and ineffective injection - furthermore being
     I should have been able to receive an exemption, but my GP could not due to pressure from
     AHPRA (run by non medical bureaucrats). Now in other countries, GPs are refusing
     ashmatics the covid ‘vaccine’...
   • I could go on and on and on, but I won’t waste my time as I have zero faith in this inquiry -
     please prove me wrong.
