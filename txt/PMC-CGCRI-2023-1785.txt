Re: The impact of the measures the Federal Government took during the COVID 19 pandemic

I wish to express my profound disappointment in the actions the federal government took during the
COVID 19 pandemic. Not only the effect it had on myself and my family but on the broader
community.

It was evident early on that COVID 19 was an illness that mostly affected the elderly and this has
been born out in the statistics, as the median age of death from or with COVID was 84.2 years (82.6
years for males and 86.2 years for females). This compares with the median age of death in 2019 of
81.7 years (78.8 for males and 84.8 for females).
Based on these statistics the question must be asked as to why support payments were offered to
health working age people if they were put out of work due to lockdowns. The fact that these
payments were offered enabled the premiers of the states to enforce lockdowns without receiving a
backlash from the populous.
It would have been prudent that instead of offering support payments, government resources would
be more effectively utilised by putting in place systems to protect the elderly and the vulnerable, this
being the cohort most at risk of serious illness.
The government committed $291 billion in direct economic support during the pandemic, as the
economy was stalled this has now created inflationary pressures and we are now apparently in a cost
of living crisis. This is a classic case of actions have consequences, and this was completely
foreseeable. Please see graph below for support payments
Before 2019-20, welfare spending in Australia had grown with modest rates of 3.4% in 2017-18 and 1.4% in 2018-19,
then reached growth rates in 2019-20 and 2020-21 of 12.7% and 11.1% respectively (Figure 1). Total welfare
expenditure decreased 8.0% in 2021 -22 in real terms. However, the 2021-22 value was still above the long-term trend
(Figure 2).

As a non vaccinating family I was deeply disturbed that the federal government provided the state
governments access to the Australian Immunisation register. This enabled the state governments to
introduce no jab no job. Coercive vaccination policies have no place in a liberal democracy, which up
to the start of COVID I believed Australia was. For some people who chose not to take the vaccine,
they were barred from working and had to sell their house                and, for others they were on
welfare paymentsWhy would the government deliberately make people
unemployed? That is a breach of human rights, if we are unable to participate fully in society
because we have chosen not to take a medicine, the state effectively owns us.

In closing I would like to state that the response to COVID has shaken my belief in the government
and the medical system. It was total overeach, yes this was a novel virus, however there was already
a pandemic response plan which Tony Abbot devised, for reasons which have never being fully
explained the government chose to ignore this plan and go down an untested, unreasonable plan
and we are now living with the consequences.

On a positive note since it was allegedly a one in a hundred year pandemic I won't have to live
through another one in my lifetime.
