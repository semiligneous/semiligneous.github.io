                                          SUBMISSION TO COVID-19 INQUIRY

This submission, made in my personal capacity as a private citizen, is responsive to the Key health response
measures outlined in the Inquiry's terms of reference, and focuses on the Australian public health response to
COVID-19 from around late 2021.

From late 2021 Australia embarked on a laissez-faire COVID-19 management policy characterised by minimal
government intervention or a deliberate 'let it rip' approach. This submission argues that this approach is a
negligent and reckless abrogation of government responsibility, in which the needs of the economy are
prioritised over individual health.

'Consent' for this approach has been maintained by a flimsy architecture of myth and misinformation,
propagated not only by government itself but also the media. In this regulation vacuum, responsibility for
health has been pushed onto the individual ('personal responsibility'), creating an intolerable situation for
many individuals who by choice or necessity seek to avoid infection.

Dismantling of public health measures
At the end of 2021, Australia progressively dismantled almost every public health measure that had previously
made it one of the safest countries in the world in which to live during the early stages of the pandemic.

Although the opening up of the country was done after crucial vaccination thresholds had been approximately
reached, this was supposed to be a controlled process, based on expert modelling from the Doherty Institute
which predicted modest rates of death and infection.1 The subsequent opening of Australian international and
state borders concurrent with the emergence of the Omicron variant ('Omicron') resulted in a nation-wide
explosion of cases, with COVID-positive people unable to access tests, or even report their infection.

Following this chaotic sequence, the relaxation of protection measures such as masking and density limits,
etc., culminated in late 2022 when isolation requirements for COVID-positive persons were dispensed with.
This decision was indefensible from a clinical perspective, and clearly the result of overwhelming political
pressure to 'return to normal.' It was openly justified pursuant to a policy of ending 'covid-exceptionalism.'

Unfortunately, for reasons that should be apparent, COVID-19 is exceptional. It was a novel virus that turned
the world upside down. In 2022, COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in Australia2 and a
contributory cause to the two other leading causes of death. Under COVID-19 we have experienced a drop in
life expectancy3 and excess mortality rates have been recorded in every Australian jurisdiction.4 These metrics
are obviously extraordinary and exceptional.

Myth: COVID-19 is mild
Throughout the course of the pandemic and especially in the last two years, leading health professionals in
publicly-funded positions have consistently minimised the risk of COVID-19. By way of example, former Deputy
Chief Health Officer Dr Nicholas Coatsworth said that infection from Omicron is not any more dangerous to
young adults and children than influenza.5

Unfortunately, this belief is as commonplace as it is incorrect. Leading long COVID researcher and clinical
epidemiologist at the Washington University School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs at the St. Louis Health
Care System, Dr Zyad Al-Aly, has shown that the risks of COVID-19 are higher than influenza because of the
extensive damage it can cause to nearly every organ system of the body.6

His studies reflect what Professor Raina MacIntyre has described an 'enormous amount of evidence around
chronic long-term conditions caused by COVID.'7 To name a few, these conditions are: diabetes, cardiac
problems, kidney injury, liver damage, erectile dysfunction, hearing loss, immune dysfunction, brain and
memory dysfunction, ocular damage.8

Dr Al-Aly's studies have also shown that even two years following mild infection, any person is at elevated risk
of many long COVID-related conditions9 and that the chance of these complications increases with each
infection.10 A recent Statistics Canada report showed that 1 in 9 Canadian adults experienced long-term
COVID-19 symptoms, and that the percentage of those experiencing long-term symptoms increases with the
number of infections.11

Given that a recent Parliamentary Inquiry into long COVID accepted that the condition affects between 5-10
per cent of persons per infection,12 and people are now accruing repeat infections, at what point will the
government intervene with more pro-active protection measures? A cynical answer might be: when the
economy suffers due to labour shortages, but we are already arguably at that point.13

The panel should recommend that the government provide responsible and accurate public health messaging
in relation to COVID-19 and reasonable protective measures in addition to vaccination. The expert
recommendations in relation to indoor air quality and ventilation of the long COVID inquiry provide a good
starting point for action, however, there is no discernible progress.

The myth of immunity
The abandonment of protection measures in Australia was also premised on the assertion that infection with
COVID-19 would confer some sort of immunity to the virus. This idea was so pervasive that many individuals
misapprehended that they would only be infected with the virus once, and agreed with opening up on that
basis.

Public messaging about immunity was most salient in Queensland where during the first Omicron wave, Chief
Health Officer Dr John Gerrard advised his constituents that COVID-19 infection was not only 'inevitable' but

also 'necessary'14 and that Queensland was developing a 'wall of immunity'.15 This messaging underscored the
reality of Australia's COVID-19 governance: control infection by allowing infection. A high-risk strategy such as
this might be acceptable if it was guaranteed to work.

As Australia works through its eighth or ninth wave of COVID-19, the experts who were warning that there is
no such thing as lasting immunity from a SARS virus look more and more credible. There is now a noticeable
change of tone in relation to COVID-19 media reporting as many people grapple with their second or third
infection and realise that they are in fact engaging in a dangerous gamble with their health each day. Many
media organisations seem to be realising that the concept of 'immunity debt' is also false as other disease
outbreaks cannot credibly be blamed on lockdowns that occurred more than two years ago.

It should not be controversial to suggest that there is no lasting immunity for currently circulating strains of
COVID-1916 and that a policy of mass infection is therefore misguided. There is alarming recent research that
an Omicron infection may actually increase a person's susceptibility to subsequent infection.17 And further
research that COVID may damage our immune system18, which would explain global outbreaks and prevalence
of RSV and other common illnesses.

Conclusion
Australia has adopted a dangerous path in relation to COVID-19 management, made possible through a
deliberate minimisation of the risks of repeated infection, and a climate of misinformation surrounding the
disease. It is not an exaggeration to say that state agencies, institutions and workplaces are in danger of
eventually being found to be negligent for failing to protect people from the known risks of this disease,19 to
say nothing of the reasonable adjustments that should have been made for aged, disabled, and
immunocompromised individuals who are at increased of severe outcomes from COVID-19.

This submission would also further add that commuting responsibility for health onto individuals ('personal
responsibility') is not a fair or sustainable approach to health management during a pandemic. This is
particularly so when the government at federal and state level has disappeared COVID-19 data that people
were using to assess risk. Due to Australia's laissez-faire COVID-19 management policy of the last two years,
many disabled, immunocompromised and healthy individuals who simply do not wish to contract COVID-19
have been forced to shield to varying degrees from family, friends and wider society. Misinformation and
ignorance about the virus is so profound that many people who do protect themselves with respirators for
example are often treated with hostility or pathologised as having an anxiety disorder, which is very wrong and
also damaging to relationships. This situation is incredibly unfair and is testament to a colossal failure of public
health in this country.

The Australian government urgently needs to protect its citizens from COVID-19. It needs to provide
accurate and responsible information in relation to how it is spread and the true risks of the disease, and re­
introduce sensible protection measures in addition to vaccination efforts.
