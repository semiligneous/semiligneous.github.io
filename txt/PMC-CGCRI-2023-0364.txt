A couple of years ago, I was waiting for my Dad outside our local medical clinic who had gone in to
get a new script when I was approached by no less than 5 armed PSOs who surrounded me and
demanded to know why I wasn't wearing a mask.

I was perfectly healthy, not sick at all but because I wasn't wearing a mask, I was labelled as a health
threat to others.

HOW????

How can a perfectly healthy, non-infected male be considered a risk to other's health for not wearing
a mask??
