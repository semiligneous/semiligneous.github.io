   Submission to the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

                            Professor Kim Rubenstein,
       Faculty of Business Government and Law, University of Canberra and
                            Honorary Professor, ANU
                                22 February 2024

I am grateful for the opportunity to make a submission to this inquiry, and I would be
delighted to meet the panel members in person to answer any questions flowing from my
submission.

I am the author of Australian Citizenship Law (2nd edition, 2016, Thomson Reuters, 1st
edition 2002, Law Book Co).

In addition, as a practitioner on the roll of the High Court of Australia, I have been
Counsel in three High Court matters concerning Australian citizenship and have appeared
before the Full Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal regarding matters
involving the interpretation of the Australian Citizenship Act.

Between November 2004 and 30 June 2007,1 was a consultant to the Commonwealth of
Australia, represented by the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural and
Indigenous Affairs, now the Department of Immigration and Border Control (the
Department) in relation to its review and restructure of the Australian Citizenship Act
1948 which resulted in the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 (the Citizenship Act) which
came into force on 1 July 2007.

In 2008 I was a member of the Independent Committee established by the then Minister
for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Evans, reviewing the Australian Citizenship Test.
I therefore assisted in the drafting of its report Moving Forward: Improving pathways to
Citizenship http://www.citizenship.gov.au/jpdf/moving-forward-report.pdf and there are
aspects of that experience that are relevant to my response to these provisions.

I am providing this written submission with the hope of expanding upon it in oral
evidence before the Commissioners.

Terms of reference

I appreciate the Inquiry is reviewing the Commonwealth Government’s response to the
COVID-19 pandemic to make recommendations to improve response measures in the
event of future pandemics. I also understand it will consider opportunities for systems to
anticipate, adapt and respond to pandemics in areas of Commonwealth Government
responsibility more effectively.

I acknowledge the Inquiry is adopting a whole-of-government view in recognition of the
wide-ranging impacts of COVID-19 across portfolios and the community.




                                                                                             1
My submission relates to the following aspects of the Terms of Reference:

   •   Governance including the role of the Commonwealth Government,
       responsibilities of state and territory governments, national governance
       mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination Mechanism
       and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee).
   •   International policies to support Australians at home and abroad (including about
       international border closures).

Constitutional structures

It is my view that the Commonwealth neglected its responsibilities to provide safe and
accessible quarantine for travellers in and out of Australia. The Australian Constitution
provides the Commonwealth with a head of power under section 51(ix) Quarantine.

I was on the record commenting publicly on these issues.

Supporting Australians at home and abroad

I provided legal advice in the application made by two Australians stranded outside of
Australia before the Human Rights Committee under the Optional Protocol for the
International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.

Moreover, in this scholarly piece

              | and I used Australia as a case study to analyse restrictions on international
movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions on inbound and outbound travel
were a key tool deployed by governments across the globe to suppress the COVID-19
pandemic. We use ‘COVID zero’ Australia as a case study to assess an extreme response
to restricting international movement. We look at the recent complaint launched before
the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. The action was raised with the
support of a group of Australian citizens stranded abroad with the assistance of the expert
in Australian constitutional law who is the second author of this paper. We argue that the
measures implemented by Australian governments to effectively eliminate COVID-19
domestically have provided insufficient consideration of, and alternatives to, the current
system’s failure to facilitate essential international travel. For this reason, Australia’s
framework for restricting international movement lacks proportionality and necessity
from the perspective of human rights and freedoms.

I would be delighted to elaborate upon this submission in person.
