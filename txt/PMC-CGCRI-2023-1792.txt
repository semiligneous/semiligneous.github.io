Please see part of my Covidl9 experience below:

My name is                 I am a Registered Nurse who is still unable to return to
nursing due to the mandates. I have multiple serology results to prove I have
natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed by my doctor). I chose not to
participate in the global vaccination roll-out. The vaccine roll-out is contrary to
my training. The current restrictions placed upon me are unreasonable and
illogical. I am not a threat to anyone in a healthcare setting or in the wider
community. The state of Victoria needs nurses, however discriminatory policies
continue.

Another issue that needs to be addressed is the serology testing. I have phoned
to ask pathology what variant I suffered. Strangely, they can never tell me. They
have confirmed that the serology test cannot define between variants. How do
health and government officials distinguish between variants when labs can't? I
find this very strange.

I'd also like to raise the treatment I have received from doctors. I have
requested a written exemption so I can return to work, but so far have been
refused. The doctors are afraid of potential negative repercussions from
government and regulators. They have told me this themselves and I have
recorded evidence of this. Their responses seem very script-like.

Privacy, dignity and safety needs to be restored. Coercion plays no part in
informed consent.
