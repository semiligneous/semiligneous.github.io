I simply wish to say that Government ie Federal and State should not intrude into our lives as it did
during COVID and the heavy handedness that Police used was unacceptable.

 If unelected or elected people say they are following the science then it should be produced to the
public.These people need to be absolutely transparent and not to play politics;they need to declare
their affiliations or not to organisations like WEF or WHO or UN.

There to be no restrictions placed on people ie mandates or restricted movements nor any
vilification of people who make a decision for themselves.

We do live in a democracy and want our freedom of speech and choice to prevail
