Subject: Submission to the Australian Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry

Dear Committee Members,

I am writing to express my deep concerns and provide input regarding the Australian Commonwealth Government's response to
the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, my submission highlights governance issues, the broader impacts of lockdowns and vaccine
mandates, and the potential legal implications arising from the discovery of DNA material in vaccines without the approval of the
Office of Gene Technology.

1. Governance and Responsibilities:

a) Role of Commonwealth Government: The Commonwealth Government plays a vital role in managing the Covid-19 crisis. It is
essential that the government exercises its responsibilities in accordance with the law, ensuring transparency, accountability, and
adherence to regulatory processes. Upholding the principles of good governance is crucial to maintain public trust and confidence.

b) Responsibility of State and Territory Governments: State and territory governments must also fulfill their responsibilities in
accordance with the law and regulatory frameworks. Compliance with relevant regulations, coordination with the Commonwealth
Government, and respecting individual rights and freedoms are paramount to a well-coordinated and effective response.

c) National Governance Mechanisms: The National Cabinet and advisory bodies should function as mechanisms for collaborative
decision-making, grounded in expert advice. These mechanisms should ensure compliance with existing regulatory requirements
and foster transparency, particularly when making decisions that may affect public health and individual rights.

2. Broader Impacts and Vaccine Mandates:

a) Legal Implications: If DNA material is found in vaccines without approval from the Office of Gene Technology, it raises serious
concerns regarding the legality of the vaccine rollout. Compliance with regulatory processes, including obtaining appropriate
approvals, is crucial to ensure the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Any deviation from these processes undermines public trust and
may have legal implications that need to be addressed.

b) Transparent Communication: Transparent communication with the public is essential, especially when addressing potential legal
concerns surrounding the vaccine rollout. The Commonwealth Government should proactively provide accurate and accessible
information regarding the regulatory processes involved, ensuring that the public is well-informed and aware of any potential
deviations from regulatory requirements.

c) Ensuring Accountability: Considering the discovery of DNA material in vaccines without proper approval, it is important to ensure
accountability within the regulatory framework. The Commonwealth Government should conduct a thorough investigation into the
circumstances surrounding this issue, identify any lapses, and take appropriate measures to address any legal breaches.

In conclusion, effective governance, adherence to regulatory processes, and transparent communication are crucial in managing
the Covid-19 pandemic. The potential discovery of DNA material in vaccines without the approval of the Gene Technology
Department raises significant legal concerns that must be addressed promptly and thoroughly.

Thank you for considering my submission. I am available and willing to provide any further information or clarification as required.

Yours sincerely,
