I would like to introduce myself. I am a mother of^grown-up children, ranging in age from
old to             old. I have been working as a teacher's aid this year and will continue to do so next
year as well as taking on a role of teaching some migrants English.

I understand that there is an inquiry into the COVID-19 Response and that it covers


    •        both the health and non-health responses
    •    responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government and the role of state and territory
         governments
    •    how national governance arrangements including National Cabinet, informed decisions by
         governments.

I will tackle these all under the one umbrella. I am particularly concerned about the COVID-19
Response by both the Federal Government as well as the State Governments mainly because the
responses trampled over our human rights and God-given freedoms. In Australia, we have always
prided ourselves on being a country that supports freedom of speech and that 'we are not like those
other dictatorial countries which clamp down on people voicing their opinions'. And yet during the
COVID-19, we became exactly like 'those other countries!'. Many people have fled other countries
due to their oppressive regimes, and come to Australia seeking refuge, and yet we have ourselves
have become an oppressive regime! And we are continuing to do so as the Federal Government is
persistent in pushing their Misinformation and Disinformation Bill.

The other reason why I feel so strongly on this issue is because COVID-19 is not this life-threatening
disease which needed these strong-arm tactics. It was blown out of all proportion. It is similar to the
flu, and as such even today, when someone has got COVID, they are suggested to stay home, and it is
treated as something you get over in a few days.

I feel that by totally exaggerating the dangers of COVID-19, it enabled Governments both Federal and
State to use it as a vehicle by which they could take away our human rights, and they certainly did.
Who would have believed that Australia would be a place where police shoot at its own people with
rubber bullets for simply protesting! These people were not engaged in any illegal activity or crime,
but were simply exercising their rights to say no in a peaceful protest.

The irony of the situation is that we still have people today dying from COVID-19, and yet we are not
in lock-downs! We are going about our normal lives, and this is what we should have been able to do
all along during this time. We think the COVID-19 pandemic existed from about March 2020 to
somewhere around the end of 2021. However the 'pandemic' is still with us. It's just our response
to it has changed and our response of isolating the sick, not the healthy is what we should have been
doing all along.

On the Australian Bureau of Statistics website1, there is an article called 'COVID-19 Mortality in
Australia: Deaths registered until 30 September 2023'. Here is a copy of a table from that site.

In Australia, we have had lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne. In Melbourne, we had 6 lock-downs
and they were from March 2020 to October 2021. If we notice that after the lockdowns were lifted,
we have had more people dying from COVID-19, and yet we are going about doing our business and
educating our young people, and living with COVID-19, like we should have been doing from the very
start.

My recommendations to improve Australia's preparedness for future pandemics is that we follow the
science, not the money. Science is about hearing a range of opinions and collectively working out a
solution. Science is not about purposely squashing an alternate view just because it differs to ours.

However, where money and control are concerned, that is when opposing views are squashed and
trampled on.

My recommendations are as follows:

1.    Do not allow the World Health Organization to dictate to Australia what it should or should not
      do in a pandemic. We are a sovereign state and by ceding to the WHO, we are giving away our
      right to manage ourselves.


2.    We should determine if there are any biases going on with the people who are making major
      decisions, ie are people or organizations being paid to support a certain viewpoint?


3.    Make sure that freedom of speech is always deemed as of the highest importance.



George Orwell, in his book, 1984, wrote it as a warning against totalitarian governments. With these
governments, they control people's minds and thoughts through propaganda and they suppress their
people through constant surveillance. Unfortunately under the excuse of COVID-19, the Australian
government has shown total disregard for human rights and autonomy, and has caused us to start to
go down the slippery slope towards totalitarianism. Is there enough push-back to stop this down-hill
trend?
