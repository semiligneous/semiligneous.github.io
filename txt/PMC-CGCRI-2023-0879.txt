                     Attention: Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

             Regarding the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry


The scope of this enquiry does not address the most important issues that need close
examination and investigation before any worthwhile inquiry can be undertaken.

The follow matters are not addressed:

  •       origins of COVID
  •       corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts
  •   lawfulness of the establishment of the “National Cabinet” under the Commonwealth
Constitution - clause 9 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act1900 (UK)
  •       mask mandates
  •       lock downs
  •       inappropriateness of PCR testing
  •       vaccine mandates
  •   official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
transmission
  •       vaccine related deaths
  •       vaccine injuries
  •       media censorship
  •       silencing of doctors
  •       silencing of evidence offeredby diverse scientific groups
  •       silencing of whistleblowers
  •       the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors
  •       immunity provided to vaccineproviders

Only a Royal Commission can examine and adequately address the above listed issues.

The people of Australia expect the Prime Minister to honour the election promise of a Royal
Commission in to Covid and all related aspects.

Yours sincerely,
