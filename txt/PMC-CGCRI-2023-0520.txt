Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Enquiry



• Governance including the role of the Commonwealth Government, responsibilities of state
and territory governments, national governance mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the
National Coordination Mechanism and the Australian Health Protection Principal
Committee) and advisory bodies supporting responses to COVID-19.

I was impressed with the extent of the government response in very difficult circumstances,
and by the clear cooperation between the various levels of government.

• Key health response measures (for example across COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments,
key medical supplies such as personal protective equipment, quarantine facilities, and public
health messaging).
The health measures were delivered quickly in spite of poor incoming information about the
origin and extent of the danger to the population. The relevant measures and lockdowns, etc,
were well communicated. Obviously there were difficulties implementing the measures in a
timely way and, it could be argued in hindsight, some parts of the response were possibly
unnecessary. At the time, I believed that it was better to be conservative than take risks in
unknown circumstances. Rollout of the vaccination was managed very well, with highest-risk
populations favoured by early delivery.
All in all, an excellent result in the presence of clear opposition by unqualified, uninformed,
self-styled “experts” fuelled by social media misinformation.
