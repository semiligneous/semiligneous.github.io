I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute my thoughts and personal experiences
regarding the Australian Government's response to COVID-19. As a^^^^ndividual from
Melbourne, the pandemic deeply impacted my I
^^^^^^^^■This experience highlighted the unique challenges faced by my demographic,
both socially and economically, during such crises.
My central point emphasises the critical need to focus on preventing future pandemics. From
my perspective, addressing the risk of novel pathogens is something within our control. We
should aim to prevent their emergence and swiftly tackle them if they arise. Considering the
immense human and economic toll of pandemics, and acknowledging the possibility of
facing even more severe outbreaks than COVID-19, prevention must be ourforemost
objective.
I strongly believe that the new Australian Centre for Disease Control should prioritise the
prevention and control of emerging pathogens. The research paper by Bernstein et al., titled
'The costs and benefits of primary prevention of zoonotic pandemics," supports this stance
economically.Theirfindings, even under conservative assumptions and without accounting
for emerging technological advances, argue convincingly for substantial investment in
pandemic prevention.
My feedback is primarily aimed at 'preventive health measures', as outlined in the third term
of reference.

In addressing pandemic prevention, Australia must urgently consider the increasing threat
of engineered pandemics. The Inquiry's terms of reference, which focus on anticipating future
pandemics, must include this critical aspect. The growing accessibility of technologies for
designing and releasing novel pathogens is a significant concern, as highlighted by experts
like MIT Professor Kevin EsveltThis issue is also detailed in the Geneva Security report
"Delay, Detect, Defend: Preparing for a future in which thousands can release new
pandemics."
Professor Brian Schmidt AC from the Australian National University has expressed deep
concern overthe "democratisation" of biotechnology, foreseeing a future where creating new
diseases might become alarmingly simple.The expanding market for synthetic DNA and Al
tools exacerbates this risk.
Recognizing the gravity of this situation, President Biden issued an executive order in
October 2023, mandating a framework for secure DNA screening. This includes screening for
risky DNA sequences, implementing access controls, and enforcing robust oversight.
Currently, about 20% of DNA orders are unscreened, posing a significant risk.
Australia, having a permitting regime for synthetic DNA importation, should align with the US
by updating this regime.This would require labs importing DNA into Australia to adopt these
new screening measures for all orders.
However, this approach alone isn’t sufficient. Continuous advancements in biotechnology
and Al could allow users to circumvent these regulations. Thus, the Inquiry should
recommend that the Department of Industry collaborate with the Department of Health and
the CDC to establish safety standards for frontier models in Australia. This should focus on
identifying and restricting Al models that pose biosafety risks. There should be clear
expectations set for developers to ensure that Al with dual-use capabilities that pose
catastrophic risks are controlled. It's also vital to monitor biotechnological advancements to
prevent the widespread ability to engineer pathogens.

Preventing novel sequences of concern via detection and screening
Gopal et al's report from the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, titled “Securing Civilisation
Against Catastrophic Pandemics,” sheds light on the criticality of early detection in
managing pandemic threats, especially those engineered for national security disruption.
The report describes two grave pandemic scenarios: "wildfire" and "stealth" pandemics.

A "wildfire" pandemic is characterised by highly lethal and transmissible agents that could
lead to societal collapse by disrupting essential services like food, water, power, and law
enforcement. These pathogens must be virulent enough to incapacitate key workers, even
during lockdowns. Theoretically, such pathogens, comparable to those in other species, could
be engineered to affect humans.

The report also outlines the concept of "stealth" pandemics. These involve pathogens that are
initially mild or asymptomatic, with a prolonged incubation period, allowing widespread
infection before their severe impacts are recognized. Current diagnostic protocols, which
rarely sequence common colds, would likely miss such engineered pathogens.

I liken a "wildfire" pandemic to a mix of measles and ebola traits, while a "stealth" pandemic
combines elements of measles and HIV. In both cases, the rapid multiplication of cases
highlights the value of time in pandemic response.

The basic reproduction number (RO) is crucial in understanding pathogen spread. For
instance, measles, with an RO of 12 to 18, demonstrates how quickly a highly infectious
disease can escalate. Early detection of novel pathogens is vital to mitigate their impact.
Catching a pathogen by the second generation of spread and responding by the third, instead
of the fourth or fifth, could be crucial in managing bioterrorism and preventing societal
breakdown.

Thankfully, the COVID-19 pandemic has propelled advancements in early detection
technologies. In Australia, we've improved testing infrastructure and surveillance
approaches. The Inquiry should recommend building upon this progress to establish a robust
public health monitoring and early detection system. This might include routine
pathogen-agnostic testing of individuals with influenza-like symptoms who test negative for
specific pathogens, and expanding wastewater screening through metagenomics.

Publications like those from the Nucleic Acid Observatory, and papers by Australians such as
Sharma et al's "Threat Net: A Metagenomic Surveillance Network for Biothreat Detection and
Early Warning" and Liang et al's "Managing the Transition to Widespread Metagenomic
Monitoring: Policy Considerations for Future Biosurveillance," offer insights into such
systems.
In facing both natural and engineered pandemic threats, rapid detection and response
remain our most potent defence. As infectious disease landscapes evolve, prioritising and
enhancing early detection is not only a health imperative but also a matter of national
security.

The terms of reference of this inquiry primarily care about being better prepared for the
future. The evolution of public health has always been driven by forward-thinking individuals
who bring fresh ideas and perspectives to tackle health challenges. Emphasising the
importance of pandemic prevention is paramount, and this includes acknowledging and
preparing for novel methods through which pandemics could arise. Tackling these
challenges will necessitate delving into complex and sometimes uncomfortable topics, such
as the implications of Al-bioconvergence and the critical need foradvanced detection and
screening techniques for emerging pathogens. Addressing these cutting-edge issues is vital
to ensure a healthier and more secure future. Prioritising these innovative approaches in
pandemic prevention will be instrumental in safeguardingglobal health against the
ever-evolving landscape of infectious diseases.
