Commonwealth Government Covid-19 response inquiry
Submission


It is firstly important to raise two concerns about this inquiry process:

1. The actions of the state governments should be considered as they played a
major role during covid and this inquiry is meaningless without including the
states' responses.
2. The limited time frame that has been given to allow for interested parties to
prepare.

National Cabinet
   •     The national cabinet is not a constitutional recognised body.
   • Information relating to decisions made by national cabinet should have
      been made available to the public.

Public Health Messaging
   • Censorship of health messaging that presented an alternate view to that
     of the government.
   •     AHPRA's harassment and censorship of medical practitioners.
   •     Overstating safety and efficacy of vaccines.
   • Questionable and unrelenting presentation of data relating to covid
     cases and deaths to invoke fear.
   • Use of celebrity to sell government message at tax payer expense. A true
     pandemic does not need to be sold to the public.
   • Inaccurate messaging that the pandemic was a 'pandemic of the
     unvaccinated'.
   •     Promoting vaccines as the only treatment.
   • Mask mandates despite no supporting evidence, however evidence
     existed to suggest they are harmful, especially for a developing child.
   • Using inaccurate advice from unelected globalists entities such as WHO,
     WEF and UN, who should not have any power over Australians, ever.



Cost of lockdowns
   • Evidence shows lockdowns caused more harm than good, far
      outweighing any perceived benefits. Harms included job losses, financial
      ruin, increases in drug and alcohol consumption, family violence, family
      breakdowns and mental and physical illness.
  • School children were denied face to face schooling and social
      interactions.
  • Border closures cut people off from medical care and isolated families
      from loved ones.
  • Our own personal impact was the inability to attend my father's funeral
      or see him in the last days of his life to say goodbye which is something I
      will have to live with forever.



Vaccine Mandates

  • Suppression of existing treatments in order to allow emergency approval
      of an experimental drug, which was then mandated while still in the
      experimental phase. This is an abhorrent human rights violation.
  • The covid-19 "vaccines" do not constitute as a vaccine, rather they are a
      gene therapy, so should have been labelled as such.
  • Vaccine mandates cost many people their job and livelihood, despite no
      evidence that they would realistically stop the spread of covid-19.



Supports

  • Failure to acknowledge people who have been harmed by covid-19
      "vaccines".
  • Failure to issue exemptions to people who are at high risk of an adverse
      reaction and for those who have had an initial vaccine adverse reaction.
  •        Difficulty in acquiring compensation for people suffering vaccine injury.
  • Indemnity given to pharmaceutical companies has resulted in their
      indifference to vaccine injured people.
  • No informed consent given. Ingredients of vaccine was shrouded in
      secrecy.



Hospital Treatments

  •        Ineffective and dangerous treatment protocols used.
  •        Ineffective and harmful mask mandates were enforced.
  •        Suppression of safe alternate medications.
  • Inaccurate PCR testing used as a diagnostic tool even on people with no
      symptoms and in hospital for totally unrelated issues.
   • Failure to promote healthy practices such as sunlight exposure, fresh air,
     good nutrition, exercise, social interaction.



Excessive force and exclusion

   • Government use of police force to enforce (at times violently) draconian
      rules.
   • Exclusion from movement and attendance at particular services, places
      and venues unless able to show a "vaccine" certificate even though it
      does not stop transmission. It was very reminiscent of another period
      people had to show their papers.
   • Shut down of public spaces such as parks and beaches which provide
     people with healthy lifestyle facilities even though outdoor transmission
      was miniscule.



Conclusion
This submission would include many other items, the covid-19 era is truly a
whole book of government errors and draconian responses and violations of
human rights, however the time frame given to prepare submissions was
inadequate and did not allow for a more detailed response. This time will be
talked about in the future as one of the most despotic in history. We need to
learn from this time and never again impose such inhumane actions on our
people. The outcome for this inquiry must result in accountability and criminal
investigations, including state governments, for those who have harmed and
violated basic human rights.
