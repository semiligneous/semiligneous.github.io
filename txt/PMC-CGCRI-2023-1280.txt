I worked as a support worker in the community helping the aged and people
with disabilities. I lost my job, even throw the government knew that the
vaccines do not stop transmission of the virus. Not only has that affected us
financially and emotionally but the people that I cared for has lost their
support with someone that they relied on and trust. I have received phone
calls from my clients crying because they can not get the help they desperately
need. They also could not understand why I was not allowed to work. It was
okay to work all throw 2020 and up to October 2021 and then I was not
allowed to work. To this day I still haven't had Covid-19. We also missed out
attending our ^^^^^Hwedding because of border closures.

We need a thorough inquiry and Royal Commission into the handling of the
pandemic.

   •      Secret contracts
   •      Border closures
   •      Mask mandates - which cause bacteria pneumonia
   •      Lock downs
   •      Vaccine mandates
   •      Lies in the media
   •      Official misinformation
   •      Vaccines to block transmission
   •      Media censorship
   •      VACCINE INJURIES - poor treatment of victims
   •      Increase in death (since the vaccine and not covid)
   •      Silencing of doctors
   •      The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors
   •      The role of TGA (not testing the vaccine)
   •      School closures


       We must have a thorough inquiry and Royal Commission so that future
       pandemics can be handled with as minimal government overreach as
       possible. Mistakes made during these past few years should never be
       made again.
