I am demanding that a proper Royal Commission be instituted for a proper investigation into:

    •         corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts;
    •         mask mandates;
    •         lock downs;
    •         vaccine mandates,
    •   official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
        transmission,
    •         vaccine injuries;
    •         media censorship,
    •         silencing of doctors,
    •         the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors,
    •         the poor treatment of victims.


This inquiry is a whitewash. That is as plain as day.
The Government promised a Royal Commission and I demand that it keep this promise.
The COVID response cost both my wife and I our jobs, our children were unable to go to
University even after they reopened. We suffered financially and emotionally as a result of the
atrocious response by Government (State and Federal) and we want a Royal Commission that
will fully explore what happened.
This must never happen again!
