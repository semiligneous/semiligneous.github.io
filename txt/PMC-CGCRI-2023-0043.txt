            Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet




            To whom It may concern,

            Thank you for the opportunity to submit to the Australian Commonwealth Government’s
            Inquiry into the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Australasian Society of Clinical
            and Experimental Pharmacologists (ASCEPT) is the peak professional society devoted to
            advancing excellence in Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Toxicology in
            Australasia. Many of our members made invaluable contributions to the pandemic
            response locally, nationally and internationally.

            There are a number of core pharmacology principles underlyingtherapeutic decision
            makingthat should have been more fastidiously adopted in the pandemic response.(1)
            These include:

                (1) Applying principles of best practice in pre-clinical lead compound design and drug
                    repurposing
                (2) applying pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic principles to identify the
                    plausibility of potential therapies
                (3)       robust, nationally coordinated and efficient clinical trial design
                (4) timely and effective communication to consumers and health care practitioners of
                    trial outcomes and
                (5)       equitable and timely access to treatments
                (6) timely access to routinely collected health data to facilitate observational studies
                    of vaccines and treatments
                (7) leadership from the diverse specialist craft groups within ASCEPT from basic pre-
                    clinical to clinical pharmacology in the coordination of the above activities

                                                                     PHARMACOLOGISTS AND TOXICOLOGISTS




            Application of these principles can optimise use of effective pharmacological
            interventions (vaccines and treatments) and minimise use of ineffective interventions.

            In the pandemic response, there were a number of domains where significant Clinical
            Pharmacologist, Experimental Pharmacologist and Toxicologist contribution was
            important and should be replicated in any subsequent pandemic response. These
            include contributions to:

                1. the National Clinical Evidence Taskforce. There was and will be a need for rapid
                   assessment of data but consistent high quality assessment
                2.    evidence synthesis and effective communication to health care practitioners
                3. providing expert review for clinical trials of potential COVID therapies through
                   Human Research and Ethics Committees

            There were a number of domains that were clearly deficient in the pandemic response.
            Pharmacologist contribution in these domains would likely have improved outcomes and
            should be considered in any subsequent pandemic response. These include:

                1. community messaging about the risk:benefit of vaccine safety (particularly the
                   Astra Zeneca vaccine), which was inadequate
                2.    early access to vaccines
                3. community messaging around vaccine and treatment safety to counter
                   misinformation, particularly early in the pandemic
                4. developing local manufacturing capacity for medicines (both for pandemic and
                   non-pandemic medicines). There were various supply chain issues throughout
                   the pandemic, which resulted in shortages of a number of medicines.

            The absence of a national medicines information service that can provide unbiased,
            trusted information to all health professionals providing care is a notable deficit in the
            Australian medicine’s landscape, as is the recent de-funding of the National Prescribing
            Service. Medicines information needs to be underpinned by robust clinical pharmacology
            learning and implementation. We strongly encourage the development of such a service
            prior to the next emergency situation such that communication pathways and networks
            are already established.

            Yours sincerely
