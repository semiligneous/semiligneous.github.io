My submission


Hello, to whomever reads this.
I would like to express my views on this matter,
I want inquiry to delve into the following.
   1. Review the authority of AHPRA (The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation
      Agency) and their handling of the Covid pandemic, specifically their deregistering of
      any Dr who dared to question the treatment of Covid patients or the risks involved in
      taking the experimental vaccines. Who is AHPRA answerable to?
   2. Why did the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) authorise an experimental
      vaccine when there were proven drugs to treat Covid, such as Hydroxychloroquine
      with iron or Ivermectin? Who authorised the banning of Hydroxychloroquine &
      Ivermectin?
   3. How many of the health bureaucrats and ministers who authorised experimental
      vaccines and imposed vaccine mandates have or had connections to the WEF
      (World Economic Forum)?
   4. Were the vaccine mandates of experimental vaccines to keep a job unlawful or
      unethical? were they forced or coercion? Were they necessary? people had little
      choice if they wanted to continue paying their mortgage and put food on the table and
      shoes on their childrenâ€™s feet.
   5. Look into excess deaths compared to the 5-year average, look at all cause deaths
      especially those who died after receiving the experimental vaccines, how many died
      of Covid or with, look into vaccine batch numbers comparing them with deaths,
   6. What deals did the Government do with the vaccine companies? Did any
      Government minister or health bureaucrat benefit from the vaccine roll out, financially
      or promised high paying job after they leave?
