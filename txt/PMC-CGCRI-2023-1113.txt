I have worked in a Secondary College year 7 -12 as a part of the Wellbeing
Team for 14 years. The harm caused by the mandatory shut down of schools,
citing covid as the reason is still being experienced by young people, their
families and their school communities.

This inquiry is not sufficient and we need a Royal Commission into the handling
of covid by the Federal and State governments. Removal of an individuals
freedom in the form of mask mandates, mandated vaccines, curfews and
lockdowns was totally unnecessary and out of step with best health practices,
which were practiced by countries that overcame covid without the systemic
issues that we continue to have years later! I!
