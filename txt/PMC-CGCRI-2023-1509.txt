Dear Inquiry Panel Members, Required by my employer to take a vaccine to keep my job, I
experienced this as coercion and unacceptable as an Australian. Where there is risk there must be
personal choice. Informed consent to covid vaccine was impossible as government, doctors and
providers did not disclose the risk of harm from covid vaccines. Financial and other conflict of
interests of TGA, politicians, doctors and business must be declared. May you have courage to reveal
the truth. Sincerely^^^H(contact details provided, anonymous for publication)
