I wish to highlight the tremendous cost of quarantine failures, firstly by the Commonwealth
government, and secondly by other governments which did not provide fit-for-purpose
facilities.

The costs of these failures affected public health, community, mental well-being and the
economy, as well as the rights of Australians to return home and to travel within the country.

To expand on economic costs:

Australia squandered a nearly unique opportunity to remain open as a tourist destination. A
large and rapid expansion of quarantine camps (in the style of Howard Springs) would have:
    •       Greatly reduced Covid escapes from quarantine
    •       Permitted the fast return of Australians from abroad
    • Enabled our tourist industry to flourish, by safely processing a large throughput of
        tourists eager to escape Covid while taking an extended holiday.
