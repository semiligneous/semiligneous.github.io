To whom it may concern:

Re: Covid Inquiry




The government's response to the covid vaccine rollout was draconian and dictatorial. They said it
was never mandated but of course it was. People were pressured to take the covid injection to keep
their jobs to feed their families. There was no real consent as doctors were pressured to advise
people to take the injection. APHRA made sure that they could not give an objective view of whether
the covid injections were safe or not. If they went against the government's narrative, they too
would lose their jobs and be discredited. There was never enough evidence to support the push for
everyone to take the vaccines. There were no time trials.listed the adverse effects from the
injection, death included, but people were just simply not allowed to voluntarily make their own
decision.

Members of Parliament were exempt from the covid injection. They were allowed to catch the covid
virus and spread it amongst the community but everyday Australians were not. All Australians should
have free choice, whether they are members of parliament or not.

This must never happen again. Everyone has the right to decide what health treatment is right for
them.

This inquiry into the government's response to the rollout and the pressure applied on the Australian
people to take the covid injection is needed and must lead to a Royal Commission

Sincerely,
