An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine
Fees from Australian Citizens Returning from Abroad


Preface

1.   This memorandum explores selected legal issues and considerations arising from the

     mandating of quarantine charges upon returning citizens within the state of

     Queensland, Australia.     The paper seeks to explore whether the charges were

     compatible with section 55 of the Constitution and the International Health

     Regulations.1

2.   This memorandum is intended to provide general information only and is not

     intended to be legal advice. You should not rely on this memorandum without seeking

     legal advice from a qualified lawyer in relation to your specific circumstances. The

     author of this memorandum makes no representations or warranties, express or

     implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information contained herein or

     the appropriateness of any particular course of action. The author will not be liable

     for any damages whatsoever arising out of or related to the use of this memorandum

     or the information contained herein.

Background

3.   On 29 January 2020, a public health emergency was declared in Queensland under

     section 319 of the Public Health Act 20052 for COVID-19.

4.   On 19 March 2020, the Public Health and Other Legislation (Public Health Emergency)

     Amendment Act 2020 amended the Public Health Act to include powers for the Chief

     Health Officer (CHO) to make public health directions to assist in containing, or to

     respond to, the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

5.   On 28 March 2020, the CHO public health direction required anyone arriving in

     Queensland from overseas to quarantine in a hotel or other premises nominated by

     an emergency officer appointed under the Act.

6.   The Community Services Industry (Portable Long Service Leave) Act 2020 amended the

     Public Health Act to include a head of power for fees to be charged for quarantine and

     the Public Health Regulation 2018 to prescribe the fees for a person's quarantine. The

     amendments commenced on 1 July 2020 and were scheduled to expire on 18 March

     2021.

7.   On 8 March 2021, the Public Health and Other Legislation (Extension of Expiring

     Provisions) Amendment Act 2021 extended part 7AA of the Public Health Act, which

     included the head of power for fees to be charged for quarantine fees, to 30

     September 2021.

8.   Section 362MC of the Public Health Act provided for a regulation making power,

     which permitted a regulation to prescribe the fees payable for a person who is

     required to quarantine at a place other than the person's home, for example a hotel.

     These fees include the types of costs associated with the person's quarantine, for

     example, the cost of accommodation or the cost of meals.

9.   Section 61A of the Public Health Regulation set out the fees payable for quarantine.

     The initial daily accommodation fees were $135 per room, including a $15 linen

     service fee. A daily fee for meals was also payable with the fee being $65 per day for

     adults and $32.50 per day for children.

10. On 1 July 2021, the Public Health Amendment Regulation (No. 2) 2021 increased the

     cost of the daily accommodation fee by $30 per night to $165 per room per night. The

     cost of food remained unchanged at $65 per night. The cost of a single adult to

     undergo fourteen (14) days of mandatory hotel quarantine under the direction of the

     CHO is $3,220.

Issue

11. Pursuant to section 55 of the Constitution (Contention 1) and the International Health

     Regulations (Contention 2), the issue to be considered is whether it was legal for the

     Queensland Government to charge fees to Australian citizens (citizens) for mandatory

     quarantine upon returning to Australia from abroad.




                                                                                            2

Authorising Law relied Upon By The Queensland Government

12. The Queensland Government relied upon the Part 7AA (Fees for quarantine during

    COVID-19 emergency) of the Public Health Act3 specifically section 362IVIC (1) of

    Part7AA of the Public Health Act which states:

        a.   A regulation may prescribe the fees payable for a person who is required to

             quarantine at a place other than the person's home, (e.g., 'a hotel, a motel').

    And section 362MCD (1) of Part7AA of the Public Health Act states:

        b.   A person required to quarantine is liable to pay the fees prescribed by

             regulation for the person's quarantine.

13. On 1 July 2021, the Public Health Amendment Regulation (No. 2) 20214 sought to

    increase the cost of the daily accommodation fee by $30 per night to $165 per room

    per night. The cost of food remained unchanged at $65 per night.

                                     CONTENTION ONE

             BREACH OF THE INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (2005)




Contention

14. It is contended that the Queensland Government in charging fees for quarantine,

    breached its obligations and failed to comply with Article 40 of the World Health

    Organisation's (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHRs).

International Law

15. The Australian Commonwealth has the power to pass laws with respect to 'external

    affairs' under section 51(xxix) of the Constitution. The external affairs power is the

    primary power within the Constitution that enables the Commonwealth to implement

    international law into Australia. If the Commonwealth enters into a treaty with

    another nation, it will only come into force if it is given that effect by statute.5

16. In the case of Koowarta v Bjelke-Peterson6, it was held that a law which gives effect

    within Australia to an international agreement will only be valid law under section 51

    (xxix) if the agreement is with respect to a matter which itself can be described as an

    external affair. It was also held that any subject-matter may constitute an external

    affair, provided that the manner in which it is treated in some way involves a

    relationship with other countries or with persons or things outside Australia.

17. The common denominator across the four major judgements in Koowarta7,

    established that the implementation of a treaty is a valid use of power under section

    51 (xxix), at least when the subject matter is of 'international concern'.8

Was COVID-19 an International Concern?

18. Gibbs CJ in the case of the Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmania Dam Case)9, stated

    that whether a matter is of international concern depends on the extent to which it

    is regarded by the nations of the world as a proper subject for international action,

    and on the extent to which it will affect Australia's relations with other countries.

19. The World Health Organization (WHO) first declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public

    health emergency of international concern on 30 January 202010. At that time, the

    outbreak had spread to several countries outside of China, where the outbreak was

    first reported, and there were concerns about the potential for further spread and

    the impact on global public health.

20. Australia did not officially announce that COVID-19 was an international concern, as

    the announcement was made by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 20 January

    2020. However, the Australian Government immediately began implementing

    measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 even prior to the WHOs announcement.

    For instance, on 23 January 2020, Australia's Chief Medical Officer issued a travel

    advisory recommending that people avoid travel to Wuhan, China, where the

    outbreak was first reported. The Australian Government also established a national

    incident room on 27 January 2020 to coordinate its response to the outbreak and

    began implementing enhanced border measures on 1 February 2020 to screen

    incoming travellers for COVID-19. On 18 March 2020, the Governor-General declared

    that a human biosecurity emergency exists.11

21. Overall, it can be considered that the Australian Government considered the COVID-

    19 outbreak as an international concern and therefore by extension enabled the

    Commonwealth to validly carry out its external affairs obligations under section 51

    (xxix) with respect to the implementation of treaties.

Treaty - WHO International Health Regulations (2005)

22. The treaty to be considered in this contention is the World Health Organisation (WHO)

    International Health Regulations (IHRs)12. The IHRs are a set of legally binding

    international agreements that aim to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a

    public health response to the international spread of disease. The IHRs were first

    adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1969 and were revised in 2005 to consider

    the emerging global health threats, including bioterrorism, SARS, and avian influenza.

23. The current IHRs are a framework for cooperation between countries and are based

    on the principles of transparency, respect for human rights and dignity, and

    protection against unnecessary interference with international travel and trade. The

    IHRs require countries to establish and maintain core public health capacities,

    including disease surveillance and response systems, laboratory services, and

    communication systems.

24. The IHRs were adopted by World Health Assembly in 2005 and entered into force on

    15 June 2007. As a member state of the World Health Organization (WHO), Australia

    is a signatory to the IHRs and is legally bound to comply with the obligations set out

    in the regulations. Australia implemented the IHRs through the Biosecurity Act 201513,

    which replaced the Quarantine Act 1908. The Biosecurity Act provides the legislative

    framework for responding to public health emergencies, including the management

    of infectious diseases, and incorporates the provisions of the IHRs.

Article 32

25. The IHRs set out requirements for the treatment of travellers including the provision

    of accommodation and food for travellers required to quarantine; Article 32

    (Treatment of Travellers) states:

        a.   In implementing health measures under these Regulations, States Parties

             shall treat travellers with respect for their dignity, human rights and

             fundamental freedoms and minimise any discomfort or distress associated

             with such measures, including by:

                  i.   ...

                 a.    ...


                Hi.    providing or arranging for adequate food and water, appropriate

                       accommodation and clothing, protection for baggage and other

                       possessions, appropriate medical treatment, means of necessary

                       communication, if possible, in a language that they can understand

                       and other appropriate assistance for travellers who are quarantined,

                       isolated or subject to medical examinations or other procedures for

                       public health purposes.

Article 40

26. Furthermore, the IHRs set out requirements with respect to charging travellers fees

    for health measures. Article 40 prohibits member states from charging travellers

    (except for travellers seeking temporary or permanent residence) for health measures

    such as vaccination, isolation and quarantine (Charges for health measures regarding

    travellers). The section 1(c) states:

        a.   Except for travellers seeking temporary or permanent residence, and subject

             to paragraph 2 of this Article, no charge shall be made by a State Party

             pursuant to these Regulations for the following measures for the protection

             of public health:

                  I.   appropriate isolation or quarantine requirements of travel.

22. It is considered that section 1(c) is applicable to all citizens returning from abroad

    because they enjoy citizenship and therefore cannot be seeking permanent residence

    as this is already afforded as a citizenship right.




                                                                                            7

Australian Legislation Giving Effect to the Implementation of the WHO International

Health Regulati ns (2005), Article 32 and 40

28. An issue to be considered is whether the requirements of Article 32 and 40 are legally

    enforceable within Australia.

29. As mentioned, the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth) provides the legal basis for Australia's

    implementation of the IHRs and the management of public health emergencies in the

    country.

30. The Government at the time of implementation stated that14:

        a.      "adoption of the IHRs would bring significant benefits to Australia. In meeting

               international standards for the prevention and control of the international

               spread of disease, and by cooperating with the WHO and States Parties,

             Australia will be well placed to respond to public health emergencies, and in

             particular to combat a global pandemic".

        b.      Australia would be obliged to implement the IHRs with the principles of non­

               discrimination, transparency, full respect for human rights, and consistently

               with other international law instruments.

31. The Commonwealth has stated that as a member state of the World Health

    Organization (WHO), Australia must comply with the International Health Regulations

    (2005)15.

Constitution Section 51(ix) - Quarantine

32. Quarantine falls under the Constitution's power to make laws with respect to

    "quarantine" as stated in Section 51(ix) of the Constitution of Australia. The

    Commonwealth can delegate its power and did so for the operation of quarantine to

    the states in 2008 through the implementation of the National Health Security

    Agreement (NHSA).16 A key feature of the NHSA being that its implementation would

    support Australia's ability to comply with the IHRs.

Federal and State Biosecurity Legislation and Quarantine Fees

33. Prior to the 8 March 2021, the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth) was the predominate

    legislation enabling the Commonwealth to manage biosecurity risks at the national

    level, including the management of quarantine measures to prevent the entry and

    spread of infectious diseases and pests into the country.

34. In Queensland, the Biosecurity Act 2014 complements the Federal Act by providing a

    framework for managing biosecurity risks within Queensland. Both Acts work

    together to enable effective management of biosecurity risks in Australia. The federal

    government is responsible for managing biosecurity risks at the national level, while

    the state government manages biosecurity risks within its borders.

35. The Biosecurity Regulations 2017 (Cth)17 and Biosecurity Regulation 2016 (Qld)18,

    enable the prescribing of fees that may be charged in relation to 'fee-bearing

    activities' carried out by, or on behalf of, the Commonwealth in performing functions

    and exercising powers under the Act.

36. Both Federal and State legislation do not permit the charging of fees to citizens

    directed into quarantine because there are no heads of power within the legislation

    which support the exaction of fees for such purpose. On this basis, it is considered

    that the State and Federal biosecurity legislation is compliant with Article 40 of the

    international treaty and confers such rights upon Australian citizens.

Quarantine Amendment (National Health Security) Act 2008 (Cth)19

37. Despite the Quarantine Act (1908) being largely repealed and replaced by the

    Biosecurity Act (2015), it is considered that there are related provisions from the

    Quarantine Act 1908 which are still in force. Section 64C of the Quarantine

    Amendment Act is one of them.20

38. The Quarantine Amendment Act specifically incorporates the IHRs into domestic law

    by preventing the charging for quarantine being prescribed health measure.

    Specifically section 64C of the Act deals with charges for the provision of prescribed

    health measures such as quarantine in relation to travellers and states the following:


        64B Traveller definitions

                     Travellers

                (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is a traveller if:
                     (a) the person has entered Australia while undertaking a voyage
                          from another country; and
                     (b) none of the following applies:
                              (i) subject to subsection (2), the person has been immigration
                                   cleared (within the meaning of subsection 172(1) of
                                   the Migration Act 1958)-,
                             (ii) the person has been detained under section 189 of that Act;
                             (hi) the person has left Australia;
                             (iv) the person is prescribed by the regulations.
                     Note:        The regulations may prescribe the person by reference to a class of
                                  persons (see subsection 13(3 ) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003).

                (2) Subparagraph (1 )(b)(i) does not apply in relation to a person who has
                    been immigration cleared (within the meaning of subsection 172(1)
                    of the Migration Act 1958) if:
                     (a) before the person was immigration cleared, the person was
                          notified that he or she would be required to submit to the
                          provision of a prescribed health measure as soon as practicable
                          after being immigration cleared; and
                     (b) the person submits to the provision of the prescribed health
                          measure as soon as practicable after being immigration
                          cleared; and

                   (1) If a traveller is not seeking temporary residence or permanent
                       residence in Australia, no person (other than the Commonwealth) is
                       liable, under any law of the Commonwealth, to pay for the provision
                       of a prescribed health measure in relation to the traveller.



39. On 8 March 2021, the Public Health and Other Legislation (Extension of Expiring

    Provisions) Amendment Act 2021 extended part 7AA of the Public Health Act, which

    introduced a new head of power for fees to be charged for quarantine fees, to 30

    September 2021 (and which was subsequently extended).

40. Of note, it was revealed by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) that the State

    Government did not seek advice on whether charging for mandatory quarantine was

    consistent with Article 40 of the IHRs.21 On face value, the introduction of this power

    created   an    inconsistency with the Commonwealth            and    State government's

    obligations to comply with the IHR treaty, specifically Article 40.

41. The question to be considered is whether the State law (Public Health Act 2005) is

    inconsistent with Commonwealth law (Biosecurity Act 2015) , and if so, which law

    should prevail.

Constitution Section 109

42. Section 109 of the Constitution states, "when a law of the State is inconsistent with a

    law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent

    of the inconsistency, be invalid."

43. In order for section 109 to apply, there must be a valid State law and valid

    Commonwealth         law.22   On   analysis,    it is evident that both    the   Sate   and

    Commonwealth laws in question are valid (subject to the outcome of Contention

    One), because the respective parliaments had the power to enact them.

44. In the case of Clyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn,23 Higgins J established three

    circumstances in which a Commonwealth law is 'inconsistent' with a State law as

    follows:

        a.             It is impossible to follow both laws

        b.     If one law purports to confer a legal right, privilege or entitlement that the

               other law takes away or diminishes

        c.     If the Commonwealth law evinces a legislative intention to 'cover the field'

               (not applicable in this instance).

Was it impossible to comply with both laws?

45. The Biosecurity Act (2015) gives effect to Article 40 of IHRs by limiting the extent of

    fees that may be charged in relation to fee-bearing activities and which are set out at

    section 106 of the Biosecurity Regulation (2016). Specifically, the Act limits the extent

    of fees that may be charged and excludes charges for persons directed into

    quarantine. This is in contrast with Queensland's Public Health Act 2005 (modified 8

    March 2020) which gives rise to a head of power at section 362MC to charge such

    fees.

46. Whilst the Commonwealth has enumerated certain quarantine powers to the states

    via the National Health Security Agreement (NHSA).24 The states in effect, act for and

    on behalf of the Commonwealth and therefore have an obligation to comply with

    Commonwealth law. This includes international treaties to the extent that they have

    been incorporated into domestic law.

An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens
Returning from Aboard




Al. It is considered that whilst it was technically possible for Queensland to comply with

    both laws, i.e., it also had the power to waiver all fees. The reality is that the

    Queensland did not do so and which it had an obligation as it was acting on behalf of

    the Commonwealth; therefore, it failed to carry out its obligations in complying with

    the IHRs.

Did the Federal law purport to confer a legal right, privilege or entitlement that the State

law took away or diminished?

48. It is contended that the Commonwealth purported to confer the legal rights,

    privileges and entitlements prescribed by the IHRs upon the Australian people

    through legislating the Biosecurity Act (Cth). The legislation does not limit of preclude

    the implementation of Article 32 and 40 and thus the rights of which were intended

    to be conferred through the Act. Simply put:

        a.   The Public Health Act 2005 (did) purported to have legal permission to exact

             fees whereas the Biosecurity Act (Cth) did not.

49. On this basis a legal inconsistency arises akin to the case in Colvin v Bradley Brothers

    Pty Ltd,25 because the enactment of section 362MC of the Public Health Act, giving

    rise to the power to exact quarantine fees, took away and/or diminished the legal

    right conferred by the Commonwealth through the ratifying of the IHRs.

50. On this basis, because the State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth,

    the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be

    invalid.' i.e., the powers to exact fees available within the Public Health Act should

    be rendered invalid.

Teoh Principle - Breach of Natural Justice

51. In the alternative, should it be found that Article 40 of the IHRs has not been

    sufficiently incorporated into domestic law by statute and thereby rendering section

    362MC valid, alternate legal precedent exists which may still result in its defeat. This

    contention is made with reference to the case of Minister for Immigration and Ethnic

    Affairs v Teoh26 whereby it was held that where a decision-maker is required to

An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens
Returning from Aboard




    consider an international treaty as part of the decision-making process, the decision­

    maker must give genuine consideration to the obligations imposed by that treaty,

    even if the treaty has not been incorporated into domestic law.

52. In the case of Teoh, Mr. Teoh, a Malaysian national, had applied for a permanent

    residency visa in Australia on the basis that he had an Australian citizen child. The

    Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs refused his application, citing a change in

    policy that excluded children born after their parents' applications were made. Mr.

    Teoh argued that this policy was inconsistent with Australia's obligations under the

    Convention on the Rights of the Child.

53. The High Court held that the Minister was required to consider Australia's obligations

    under the Convention, even though it had not been incorporated into domestic law.

    The court found that the Convention created a legitimate expectation on the part of

    Mr. Teoh that the Minister would consider his child's best interests, and that the

    Minister's failure to do so constituted a breach of natural justice.

54. Based on the Teoh principle, a question arises as to whether the decision makers in

    amending the Public Health Act, gave genuine consideration to Article 40.

55. As mentioned, it was revealed by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) that the

    State Government did not seek advice on whether charging for mandatory quarantine

    was consistent with Article 40 of the IHRs27, this alone infers that no consideration let

    alone genuine consideration was given by the Queensland Government on the issue.

56. Of note, on the 19 April 2021 and in an effort by the WHO to remind signatories like

    Australia of their legal obligations in ensuring the enforcement of citizen rights

    conferred by IHRs28, stated that all member states were to:

           a.   Reduce the financial burden on international travellers for the measures

                applied to   them for the protection      of public health   (e.g.,   testing,

                isolation/guarantine, and vaccination), in accordance with Article 40 of the

                IHR.

57. On the known facts, it appears that the Queensland government failed to consider

    the statement made by the WHO. On this basis, it is contended that an action to bring

    about the extinguishment of section 362MC for a failure to consider the treaty should

    arise.

58. Overall, it is considered that the Queensland Government had no legal power to exact

    quarantine fees from Australian citizens returning from abroad.




                                      CONTENTION TWO

                 BREACH OF SECTION 55 OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION

Contention

59. It is contended that the Queensland Government breached section 55 of the

    Australian Constitution by levying fees for quarantine as a tax within the Public Health

    Act.

Section 55 of the Australian Constitution

60. Section 55 requires that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of

    taxation and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.

    It also requires that laws imposing taxation deal with one subject of taxation only.

61. Put simply, if the Australian Parliament passes a law to impose a tax, that law can only

    deal with the imposition of the tax itself. It cannot include provisions that deal with

    other matters, such as public health orders or imposing penalties for non-compliance.

    If such provisions are included in a tax law, they are considered to be of no effect.

62. Section 55 is designed to prevent the government from using its power to impose

    taxes to achieve other policy objectives that may be unrelated to taxation. By limiting

    the scope of tax laws to the imposition of taxation only, the Constitution aims to




                                                                                            15
An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens
Returning from Aboard




    prevent the Government from using the tax system as a backdoor to circumvent other

    constitutional provisions or to infringe upon individual rights and freedoms.

63. If it can be determined that the 'fees' levied under section 362MC (1) of Part7AA of

    the Public Health Act are a 'tax' for the purpose of Section 55, then the section will be

    determined invalid and unenforceable because the Public Health Act deals with

    matters other than the 'imposition of taxation' e.g., Public health risks and orders.

Particulars

64. On 8 March 2021, the Public Health and Other Legislation (Extension of Expiring

    Provisions) Amendment Act 2021 extended part 7AA of the Public Health Act, which

    included a new head of power enabling fees to be charged for quarantine, to 30

    September 2021 (and which was subsequently extended).

65. Between 28 March 2020 and 16 February 2022, the Queensland Government exacted

    quarantine fees for from citizens returning from abroad.

Issue

66. The issue to be considered is whether the fees exacted under section 362MC (1) of

    Part7AA of the Public Health Act are to be properly characterised as a law 'imposing

    taxation' on returning citizens.

67. That being so, section 362MC (1) of Part7AA of the Public Health Act will be a law

    'imposing taxation' if the fees which it purported to exact from, or with respect to,

    returning citizens from abroad, for relevant purposes be characterised as a tax29.

68. The only basis upon which it could be suggested that the fees levied under 362MC (1)

    for the purpose of quarantine was not a tax, was if it represented a 'fee for services'30.

What is a Tax?

69. In referring to the case of Lower Mainland Dairy Products Sales Adjustment

    Committee v Crystal Dairy Ltd31, Latham CJ defined the term 'tax' by stating that "a

30 Air Caledonie International V. The Commonwealth (1988) 165 CLR 462
31 (1933) AC 168, 175.

                                                                                            16
An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens
Returning from Aboard




    tax is a compulsory exaction of money by public authority for the purposes,

    enforceable by law, and is not for payment of services rendered."

70. In the case of Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board (Vic)32, Latham CJ adopted the

    three features (positive attributes) identified by the Privy Council to characterise a

    'tax' which were:

        a.            The exaction was compulsory

        b.            The exaction was for public purposes and

        c.            The exaction was enforceable by law.

71. This definition should be caveated and is considered not exhaustive to the underlying

    principle described per Latham CJ in that "there is no reason in principle why the

    compulsory exaction of money under a statutory power could not be properly seen

    as taxation."33

72. Furthermore, section 53 of the Constitution states that a proposed law shall not be

    taken to 'impose taxation' if it constitutes a 'fee for service' (negative attribute); i.e.,

    A 'Fee for services' may not be considered a tax, even if it is compulsory.34

73. The exaction of money will amount to a tax, if the three positive attributes and

    negative attribute have been sufficed.35 It was determined in Matthews v Chicory

    Marketing Board (Vi)36 and expanded by Air Caledonie, that there are several

    elements, needed to establish that an exaction is a 'fee for service':

        a.            There is a specific identifiable service

        b.            A fee is paid for the service

        c.   There is a discernible relationship with the value of what is acquired by the

             recipient and

        d.   The service is rendered to, or at the request of, the person required to make

             the payment.

Were Hotel Quarantine Fees Compulsory?

74. The Hotel Quarantine fees authorised under section 362MC of the Public Health Act,

    and prescribed within section 61A of the Public Health Regulation 2018, were made

    compulsory upon the CHO public health direction requiring anyone arriving in

    Queensland from overseas to quarantine (e.g., Quarantine for International Arrivals

    Direction (No. 9), which was made on 6 May 2021).

75. Furthermore, Section 362MCD (1) of Part7AA of the Public Health Act states:

        a.   A person required to quarantine is liable to pay the fees prescribed by

             regulation for the person's quarantine.

76. It can therefore be concluded that hotel quarantine fees were compulsory for persons

    required to quarantine.

Were Hotel Quarantine Fees For Public Purposes?

77. Pursuant to the Public Health Regulation (No.2) 202137, the purpose of charging a

    quarantine fee was to offset the cost to government for the running of quarantine.

    Specifically, the fees were raised by Government to achieve the objectives of the

    Public Health Act for example:

        a.           Preventing, controlling and reducing risks to public health; and

        b.           Responding to public health emergencies.

78. The government acknowledged38 that the fees exacted from returning citizens would

    not recover the entire costs of hotel quarantine, as the cost of security overlay for

    hotels, health support services, transport and logistics was not included in the

    calculation of the fee.

79. In Australia, the fact that a levy is directed to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue

    Fund is generally regarded as a conclusive indication that the levy exacted is for public

    purposes. The Queensland Government received extensive funding from the

    Consolidated    Revenue   Fund    for the   purposes    of establishing    and   running

    quarantine39. It is reasonable to presume that upon receipt of quarantine fees exacted

    from citizens, the Department of Health had the capacity to be remit such fees back

    into consolidated revenue.

80. On the basis that the exacted fees were used to achieve the objectives of the Public

    Health Act, it can be concluded that the fees were intended for and had the capacity

    to be used 'for public purposes'.

Were Hotel Quarantine Fees Enforceable by Law?

81. Section 362MF (Payment and recovery of fees) of the Public Health Act provides that

    the fees for hotel quarantine are enforceable by law. The section states:

        a.    A person liable to pay fees under section 362MD must pay the fees, or any

              part of the fees not waived under section 362ME.

        b.    An amount not paid by the person under subsection (1) may be recovered from

              the person as a debt due to the State.

82. Debts due to the State of Queensland are enforceable under the State Penalties

    Enforcement Act 1999 (Qld) (SPE Act). Under this legislation, if a person fails to pay

    the hotel quarantine fee, the State Debt Recovery Office may take enforcement action

    to recover the debt. This can include taking legal action, issuing a warrant for arrest,

    or garnishing wages or bank accounts.

83. It can therefore be concluded that hotel quarantine fees were and remain enforceable

    by law.

Positive Attributes Concluded

84. Overall, the fees exacted from citizens under section 362MC of the Public Health Act

    possessed all three positive attributes because the fees were a compulsory levy by a

    public authority, imposed for public purposes and enforceable by law. On this basis,

    it can be concluded that the exaction can be characterised as a 'tax' (subject to any

    other statutory impositions e.g., fee for service, privilege, penalty).

Was Hotel Quarantine Fees a 'Fee for Service?

85. As previously mentioned, section 53 of the Constitution states that a proposed law

    shall not be taken to 'impose taxation' if it constitutes a 'fee for service' (negative

    attribute). Therefore, if it can be determined that quarantine fees are considered as

    a 'fee for service' then it cannot be considered a tax.

86. As determined in Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board (Vi)40 and expanded in Air

    Caledonie, the following elements are needed to establish that an exaction is a 'fee

    for service':

        a.            There is a specific identifiable service

        b.            A fee is paid for the service

        c.   There is a discernible relationship with the value of what is acquired by the

             recipient and

        d.   The service is rendered to, or at the request of, the person required to make

             the payment.

There was no specific identifiable service.

87. The issue to be considered is whether 'quarantine' can be considered a 'service'; the

    Macquarie Dictionary defines the term 'quarantine' as:

        a.   'o strict isolation designed to prevent the spread of disease'.41

88. In conjunction, section 362MB of the Public Health Act defined the 'Meaning of

    quarantine' as:

        a.   'A person is required to quarantine if - the person is required, under public

             health direction or a direction given under section 362H(l)(a) to stay at or in

             a stated place'.42

89. The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term 'service' as:

        a.   'an act of helpful activity'f3 whereby 'helpful' is defined as 'giving or affording

             help'.43
                   44

90. To satisfy this element of the test, it must therefore be demonstrated that quarantine

    being the 'service' constituted an act of helpful activity.

91. In analysing whether quarantine could be considered a service, particularly in the

    context of a citizen returning to Australia from abroad, it is crucial to look at the

    surrounding circumstances of such a situation. The presumption is that an Australian

    citizen returning home from abroad is doing so for purposes other than participating

    in quarantine. Quarantine by its nature would generally be considered by a citizen in

    these circumstances as an unavoidable imposition necessary to endure in order to

    enter Australia for a particular purpose.

92. Upon arrival, the citizen is directed and compelled to enter an environment of social

    isolation with movement severely restricted for a period of fourteen days. It is well

    documented, even by the Qld Government, that enduring such an environment for

    this period is not conducive to good physiological and psychological outcomes.45 It has

    also been well acknowledged by Government that "Fourteen days in hotel quarantine

    system can be a difficult and taxing experience." 46 Based on the nature of quarantine

    alone, it is difficult to accept that the nature of quarantine could be characterised by

    the citizen as an act of helpful activity.

93. Furthermore, it is considered that the involuntary unavoidable imposition of

    quarantine on a returning citizen could never be considered as an 'act of helpful

    activity' because in such circumstances there is no giving or affording of help. On this

    basis, quarantine cannot be characterised as a 'service' provided to the person

    quarantined.

    A Contrary Argument

94. A contrary argument could arise in that quarantine could be contended as a service

    because it was a 'helpful activity' to the public in preventing the spread of disease in

    the community. It could also be inferred the benefit obtained by a citizen in

    quarantine would be obtained by subsequently entering an environment free from

    COVID-19 upon clearance. This unfortunately was never the reality as the

    Government's data revealed that upon the commencement of quarantine on the 28

    March 2020, the Australian Government had recorded 3,588 COVID-19 cases within

    the community; on the 16 February 2022, the day that mandatory quarantine ended

    in Queensland, there had been over three million cases of COVID-19 in Australia

    equating to 12% of the population47. It is undeniable that the causation of such

    prevalence within the community was attributable to the failings in Australia's

    quarantine system. This is supported by the several studies which identified 'systemic

    issues with infection control in hotel quarantine'.48 In the alternative, if quarantine

    was characterised as a service, the question becomes whether this service was fit for

    purpose to achieve the policy objectives - based on the evidence this would be

    difficult to contend.

95. It is contended that pursuant to the judgement in the case of Northern Suburbs

    General Cemetery Reserve Trust v Commonwealth of Australia,^9 if a particular citizen

    who paid quarantine fees derived no more benefit than the community who didn't

    incur such an impost,     it cannot be said to be a fee for service in any sense and

    therefore the fees would not be prevented from being characterised as a tax.

96. Furthermore, per the case of Air Caledonie International v The Commonwealth50 it

    was held that "a reguirement that a returning citizen submit, in the public interest, to

An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens
Returning from Aboard




    the inconvenience of such administrative procedures at the end of a journey cannot,

    however, properly be seen as the provision or rendering of 'services' to, or at the

    reguest or direction of, the citizen concerned." On the basis that returning citizens

    involuntarily submitted to an administrative procedure i.e., compliance with the

    directions issued by the CHO, it is difficult to conclude that quarantine constituted a

    specific identifiable service.

In the alternative, there was no fee paid for the service.

97. On the basis that quarantine could not be characterised as an identifiable service,

    any fee for such would automatically be precluded from eventuating.

98. A contrary position could consider that the Public Health Regulation prescribes

    specific fees amounting to $3,220 for a mandatory 14-day quarantine period under

    section 61A being:

        a.           $165 per day for accommodation and

        b.           $65 per day for meals.

99. The regulation attempts to tie the prescribed fees directly to the cost of

    accommodation and meals; however, it is contended that this is not necessarily

    accurate and perhaps more so a convenient mechanism by the Government to mount

    a defence that the fees are charges for services. This contention is on the basis that

    section 61A(1) states that the fees are "fees for a person's guarantine," whereby it

    should be considered that the wider object of the legislation is to exact fees to defray

    the total costs of quarantine.

100. In analysing the legislation, there is nothing preventing the Government from

    using the funds raised for purposes other than accommodation or meals. This view is

    supported within the Public Health Amendment Regulation (No.2) explanatory

    notes51 which state that the purpose of the fees is "To support costs for hotel

    guarantine continuing to be sustainably managed". This statement implies that the

    purpose of the costs exacted are to partially offset public funds expended on

    quarantine; therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude that the purpose of the

    regulation is to appropriate revenue for such purpose.



51 Public Health Amendment Regulation (No. 2) 2021, Explanatory notes for SL 2021 No. 82

                                                                                           23
An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens

101. This issue also gives rise to the question as to whether the Government can

    cherry-pick specific activities of quarantine and classify them as services. For example,

    the Public Health Amendment Regulation (No. 2) 2021, explanatory notes,52 states

    that fees were calculated without regard for to following costs:

        a.           security overlay for hotels,

        b.           health support services,

        c.           transport and logistics.

    However, there was nothing preventing the Government from using the fees raised

    to pay for such costs; or any other liabilities incurred by the Department of Health.

102. The Public Health Act and Public Health Regulation, imposes no requirement that

    the Queensland Government agree to expend the money exacted from citizens on

    accommodation and meals. On this basis, there is no statutory warrant for concluding

    that such a charge could amount to a fee for service.53 Therefore, by extension no

    fee could have been paid for the service.




    Rule in Air Caledonie

103. Per Air Caledonie International I/. The Commonwealth54, if the moneys raised by

    legislation, when paid, were used for the general off-setting of the administrative

    costs of certain areas of the relevant Department (e.g., Department of Health), then

    the fee at least in so far as it related to citizens would be considered a tax and the

    provisions of the law would be a law 'imposing taxation'.

104. In analysing section 362MC (Fees Payable) of the Public Health Act, the Act

    authorises the exaction of fees by the Department of Health without limitation to

    persons who are required to quarantine at a place other than that person's home.

    There is no limitation as to how the Department of Health uses the exacted fees, and

An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens

    therefore without limitation, the fees may be used for the general off-setting of the

    administrative costs of certain areas. This alone, may be considered sufficient to

    determine that section 362MC imposed taxation.

105. It can be considered that in any event, the quarantine fees amounted to a

    mandatory charge imposed upon citizens for the privilege of entering Australia. Per

    the rule in Air Caledonie International I/. The Commonwealth55, "The right of the

    Australian citizen to enter the country is not gualified by any law imposing a need to

    obtain a license or 'clearance' from the Executive".

    Conclusion

106. Overall, the Public Health Act and Public Health Regulation do not by their terms

    establish any sufficient relationship between the liability to pay the charge and the

    provision of accommodation and meals with the ultimate expenditure of the money

    collected to regard the liability to pay the charge as a fee for services. This position

    was held in Northern Suburbs General Cemetery Reserve Trust 1/ Commonwealth of

    Australia.56

In the alternative there was no discernible relationship with the value acquired.

107. In Air Caledonie, Latham CJ stated "if the person reguired to pay the exaction is

    given no choice about whether or not he acguires the services and the amount of

    exaction had no discernible relationship with the value of what is acguired, the

    circumstances may be such that the exaction is, at least to the extent that it exceeds

    that value, properly to be seen as a tax." On the basis that quarantine fees amounted

    to a compulsory exaction, two questions arise being:

        a.           Is there a 'discernible relationship'? and

        b.           What value is acquired by a citizen through quarantine?

    Discernible Relationship

108. In the case of Australian Capital Territory v Queanbeyan City Council, Stone J held

    that the calculation of the fees is negligible in determining whether a discernible

                                                                                            25
An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens
Returning from Aboard




    relationship exists and that there must be a relationship between the charge and the

    value of the commodity or service in question.57 On the basis, it could be inferred that

    the fees exacted for accommodation and meals by the Government bear no

    relationship to whether a discernible relationship exists.

109. It should also be considered that the quarantine program exhibited monopoly

    characteristics   because     the   Government       had    complete       control   over   its

    implementation and the legislation did not seek to place any limitation on the

    amounts it could charge. The approach of Gummow J in Airservices58 was that the

    provision of goods and services under monopoly conditions mean that there is no

    market by reference to which a value can be discerned and therefore some other

    measure of value is to be used. This means that to assess the value acquired by the

    citizen, analysis of the environment and surrounding circumstances could be used as

    an alternate measure of value.

110. In the case of Australian Capital Territory v Queanbeyan City Council, a

    "discernible relationship" was described as a very low threshold in which It does not

    posit that a fee should represent good value.59 In the context of mandatory

    quarantine, the question then becomes one of how "discernible relationship" with

    "value" is to be determined in such circumstances?

    Air Caledonie Test

111. The test promulgated in Air Caledonie, states that there must be a discernible

    relationship with the value acguired.

112. The Macquarie dictionary defines the term 'value' as:

        a.            (noun) "equivalent worth or equivalent return: for value received."

         b.   (verb) "to consider with respect to worth, excellence, usefulness, or

              importance."

An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens
Returning from Aboard




     Furthermore, it is suitable that the natural meaning of "value" is "net value" and that

     a calculative approach which accounts for any detriment, damage or loss should be

     applied.

113. The Macquarie dictionary defines the term 'acquired' as:

         a.     "to come into possession of; obtain."

     Value Acquired

114. On the basis that citizens returning to Australia from abroad were given no choice

     about whether they underwent quarantine, the phraseology of the second half of the

     test is crucial. The word 'value' and the reference to 'what is acguired' imply that the

     Court will look at the value of the service as perceived by the recipient, rather than

     looking at the cost to the Government of providing the service.60 The proposition that

     a fee may bear some relation to the cost of the service has been established61;

     however, Air Caledonie modifies and expands the definition of 'fee for service' in that

     the service must be 'of value' to the recipient rather than a reflection of the cost to

     the Government in providing the service.

115. Government bodies are accustomed to testing the legality of a 'fee for service' by

     reference to the cost of supporting the service, under the Air Caledonie rule,

     governments can no longer rely on this but rather must determine the actual value of

     the service to the recipient. The Public Health Regulation references the calculation

     of the fees to the cost of the supporting service without any consideration of the value

     acquired by the citizen - it is contended that this is a major flaw in the Regulation and

     one which will be difficult for the Government to overcome.

     Facts

116. The fees exacted for a single adult in undergoing fourteen (14) days of mandatory

     quarantine under the direction of the CHO was $3,220 and which was pursuant to the

     Public Health Amendment Regulation (No. 2) 2021 enforced from 1 July 2021.

An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens
Returning from Aboard




117. The fees were levied by the Government to "support the costs for hotel

    guarantine continuing to be sustainably managed",62 this statement alone infers that

    the calculation is referenced to the cost of providing the service without considering

    the actual value of the service acquired by the recipient.

118. Prima facie, it would be simple to conclude that the purported value transferred

    from the Government and acquired by the recipient was the provision of

    accommodation and food for a fee of $165 and $65 per day respectively, and that

    these fees were proportionate to the actual costs in providing such services. As

    mentioned, this interpretation would likely to be considered erroneous as it does not

    consider the "value as perceived by the recipient" and which is required and implied

    by the second half of the test formulated by Latham CJ.

119. It is reasonable to contend that the perceived acquisition of "Value" is inextricably

    linked and/or akin to acquiring some type of benefit and which is measured in the

    context of worth, excellence, usefulness, or importance. On this basis, to satisfy the

    test, it should be demonstrated that the 'value acquired' by the citizen is somewhat

    analogous to the perceived benefit acquired.

    Value acquired - worth, excellence, usefulness, or importance

120. The presumption is that in consideration for payment of $3,220, some form of

    benefit is acquired by the citizen undergoing quarantine; therefore, it is important to

    analyse available data which documents the specific outcomes of citizens in such

    circumstances to determine whether those outcomes could be characterised as a

    benefit and by extension be characterised as valuable.

121. Prima facie, it could be considered that payment of a fee to enter mandatory

    quarantine is connected with little if any perceived value and/or benefit by the

    recipient. This is because in ordinary circumstances, it would be extremely rare that a

    reasonable person would voluntarily exchange $3,220 to confine themselves to

    solitary isolation within a small hotel room and without access to basic amenity such

    as fresh air for 14 consecutive days.

122. It is well acknowledged within Government that "Hotel quarantine is difficult to

    endure,     particularly for vulnerable people."63 This statement made by the

    Government implies an admission that negligible value is acquired by a person

    required to undergo quarantine, particularly if it was not done so voluntarily.

123. The adverse effects of quarantine for persons required to undergo 14-days of

    solitary isolation has been well documented by the Queensland Government. For

    example, numerous cases in Australia have cited extensive evidence of the harmful

    effects of social isolation on persons, particularly those who are exposed to prolonged

    periods of segregation. In the Supreme Court of Queensland case of Callanan v

    Attendee X64, Applegarth J referred to the research of Sharon Shalev, who found that

    all studies of persons held in social isolation for more than 10-days demonstrated

    negative health effects. Applegarth J also noted Shalev's finding that social isolation

    increased a person's risk of being admitted to hospital for psychiatric reasons by 20

    times65.

124. The Queensland Government itself has documented66 the adverse health impacts

    of social isolation inherent of a quarantine environment which include:

        a.             insomnia and tiredness

        b.     increased chance of developing anxiety, depression and other mental

               illnesses

        c.             elevated blood pressure

        d.             increased chance of developing dementia

        e.             negative feelings, including self-denial, guilt and self-loathing

        f.             self-harm

         g.            thoughts about suicide

         h.            increased risk of substance misuse

         i.            physical health implications, including worsening illness, weight loss or gain.

    Specific Implications

125. It is well documented that the hotels employed for the purposes of delivering

    quarantine were largely established without due consideration for compatibility with

    existing statutes and fundamental human rights. The basic facts are that in many

    circumstances, the hotels used, lacked the mandatory requirements prescribed under

    statute and international law for persons in social isolation and were not-fit-for-

    purpose67.

126. It could be concluded that where quarantine environments failed to fulfill the

    policy objectives, failed to afford basic amenity and deprived persons of their liberty,

    it would be impossible to conceive that any value was being acquired by the recipient.

127. Examples of where quarantine infringed human rights can be demonstrated by

    analysing the following law:

         a.            Corrective Services Regulation 2017 (Qld)

         b.   Queensland Human Rights Act (Section 30 humane treatment when deprived

              of liberty)

         c.   United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Detainees, Rule

              45

         d.            ICESCR Article 12.

    Corrective Services Regulation 2017 (Qld)

128. The minimum requirements for persons subjected to social isolation is governed

    by the Corrective Services Regulation 2017 (Qld). If it was considered that quarantine

    should afford citizens with equivalent rights to prisoners then there was an obligation

    to ensure persons undergoing quarantine were given the opportunity to exercise, in

An Analysis of the Legal Enforceability to Exact Quarantine Fees from Australian Citizens

    the fresh air, for at least 2 daylight hours a day which is set out in the Part 2, Division

    1 Section 4 (d) of the Regulation as follows:

        a.   The chief executive must ensure a person undergoing separate confinement is

             given the opportunity to exercise, in the fresh air, for at least 2 daylight hours

             a day, unless a doctor or nurse advises that it would not be in the interests of

             the persons health to exercise for a stated period or indefinitely.

129. It is fact that persons who underwent hotel quarantine were not given the

    opportunity to exercise, in the fresh air, for at least two daylight hours a day (and in

    many instances at all). In such circumstances where a citizen in quarantine was

    afforded less rights than a citizen in prison then it could not reasonably be perceived

    that the citizen acquired value.

    Human Rights Act 2019 (Act)

130. The passing of the Human Rights Act 2019 (Qld), as well as Australia's ratification

    of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT), requires the Qld

    Government to comply with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the

    Treatment of Detainees (the Nelson Mandela Rules), specifically:

        a.   Rule 14 - In all places where the person is required to live or work: The

             windows shall be large enough to enable the person to read or work by natural

             light and shall be so constructed that they can allow the entrance of fresh air

             whether or not there is artificial ventilation;

        b.   Rule 45 - Solitary confinement shall be used only in exceptional cases as a last

             resort, for as short a time as possible and subject to independent review, and

             only pursuant to the authorization by a competent authority.

131. It is fact that the Government's quarantine infrastructure, systems and processes

    failed to afford citizens these minimum legal requirements or to properly assess that

    directing a citizen into solitary confinement was 'a last resort'. Again, In such

    circumstances where a citizen in quarantine was afforded less rights than conferred

    under the Human Rights Act 2019 (Qld), then it could not reasonably be perceived

    that the citizen acquired value.

132.    The adverse effects of quarantine have been well documented and reported by

    persons placed into such with hundreds of complaints issued to government

    ministers, State Ombudsman's, police departments and other local government

    authorities. For example, the Queensland Ombudsman's 2020-2021 annual report68,

    noted receiving several 'complaints about the conditions of hotel guarantine, such as

    access to fresh air and food quality, as well as the cost of hotel quarantine and refusal

    of applications for waiver of costs.'

133.    The National Review of Hotel Quarantine reported that 'In the period up to 28

    August 2020, in the order of 90 complaints were made to the Human Rights

    Commission about the requirement to quarantine and/or conditions of quarantine

    including: lack of access to fresh air, food, quality of the accommodation, and size

    (especially for people with psycho- social disabilities).'69

134.    It could be concluded these represent instances of where the citizen perceived no

    acquisition of value.

    Lack of Government Evidence

135.    The Government has never evidenced the actual conferred or perceived value by

    the recipient in exacting fees for quarantine. On that basis, it is impossible to conclude

    that the amount of the exaction has a discernible relationship with the value which

    was acquired by the recipient.

136.    This notion, disposes the idea that the fees exacted for quarantine, can amount

    to a transfer of value because any claim of such is fundamentally flawed on the basis

    that there is no discernible relationship with the value acquired by the recipient.

In the alternative, the service was not rendered to, or at the request of, the person

required t make the payment.

137.    To satisfy the fourth element of the test in Air Caledonie, the service must have

    been rendered to, or at the request of, the person required to make the payment.

138.    The stated objective of quarantine by the Queensland Government was to

    "reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission within the community and protect the

    health and safety of Australians." It would be reasonable to presume that the persons

    who received the benefits (if any) of quarantine were the Australian public who

    resided outside of the quarantine system.

139.    A perceived benefit to the Australian public could be conferred because the

    implementation of a quarantine system minimised the risk of exposure to potentially

    infectious citizens returning from abroad thus minimising their risk of infection.

140.    It is simple to reason, that the public would benefit from a community free from

    Covid in a similar way that a pig farmer benefits from a farm free from African swine

    fever, due in part, to an effective quarantine system. By analogy, if a farmer wanted

    to keep his farm disease free, he could establish a quarantine system which would

    require all new pigs entering his property to spend a suitable amount of time isolated

    in a pen separated from the rest of the herd. During this time the farmer would ensure

    his pigs were fed and sheltered so that they didn't die knowing that he would

    ultimately benefit from doing so. In this instance, the services are rendered to and for

    the benefit of the farmer and not the pigs in the pen. Similarly, this analogy applies to

    quarantine in that the public ultimately derive any benefits of quarantine and thus

    the services are being provide to them.

141.    Another key aspect of this contention is that the benefit can only be derived if

    the quarantine system is effective. As mentioned, over three million COVID-19 cases

    were recorded in the community during the mandatory quarantine period which

    indicates that the Covid quarantine system was in fact ineffective.

142.    Overall, it can therefore be concluded that quarantine services were rendered to,

    or at the request of, the Australian public (including the Executive) and not the citizen

    in quarantine.

Conclusion

143.    The issue to be considered is whether the fees exacted under section 362IVIC (1)

    of Part7AA of the Public Health Act are to be properly characterised as a law 'imposing

    taxation' on returning citizens.




                                                                                          33

144.    It is evident that quarantine fees satisfied the three positive attributes of a tax

    being that they were compulsory, were for public purposes and were enforceable by

    law. It is also evident that the fees exacted failed to satisfy the required negative

    attribute because there was:

        a.           No specific identifiable service

        b.           No fee paid for the service

        c.   No discernible relationship with the value of what is acquired by the recipient

             and

        d.   The service was not rendered to or at the request of, the person required to

             make the payment.

        As such it is difficult to contend that the fees could be characterised anything

        other than a 'tax'.

145.    On the basis that 'fees' levied can be characterised as a 'tax', pursuant to Section

    55 of the Constitution, section 362MC (1) of Part7AA of the Public Health Act should

    be determined invalid and unenforceable because the Public Health Act deals with

    matters other than the 'imposition of taxation.'
