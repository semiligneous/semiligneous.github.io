     Call for submissions and evidence to the
     COVID-19 Response Inquiry

    Introduction

    Opira is a leading indoor air quality consultancy providing products and services to the Australian healthcare
    market. Specific services provide to the healthcare sector include:
        •         indoor air quality audits,
        •         hospital heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) management plans, and
        •         provision of infection control devices.
    The business recently celebrated it's 20th anniversary since its establishment.

    Our experience during COVID was a major increase in interest in our ultraviolet (UV254) disinfection products
    supplied by the Canadian company Sanuvox.1 Sanuvox has been supplying these products since 1995 and
    Opira has been its Australian distributor since 2011. These UVC254 products are effective in killing a variety of
    pathogens transmitted in air, including SARS-CoV-2.2

    While UVC254 products have been very popular in the Queensland healthcare sector for the control of
    pathogens in the critical care areas and for maintaining cleanliness in HVAC systems,3 there has been no such
    increase in interest from healthcare operators in other states in using this technology to limit the spread of
    COVID19 and other airborne pathogens.

    This submission seeks to address the following terms of reference:

    Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular populations (including across
    genders, age groups, socio-economic status, geographic location, people with disability, First Nations peoples
    and communities and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities).


    Capacity of UVC254 to limit the spread of airborne infections
    The air cleaning/purification market is awash with new technologies that promise to eliminate airborne
    pathogens in indoor occupied spaces. Very few of these technologies have the necessary research history
    and scientific understanding to support their claims. What separates UVC254 from other technologies is the
    very long research history of UVC disinfection against known pathogens and other microbes.4 This trend has

There is always some degree of risk with the introduction of new infection control technologies. What
distinguishes the use of UVC254 from other technologies is that the mitigation and control measures are well
established and understood, leading to increasing confidence in its application for air and surface disinfection
in the hospital sector.

The UVC254 technology has also been widely endorsed by leading Australian and international air quality
scientists. Distinguished Professor Lidia Morawska heads the International Laboratory for Air Quality and
Health (ILAQH) based in Brisbane and has been a strong proponent of UVC254 technologies to deal with the
C0VID19 epidemic.5

Recommendation 1: That the Committee consider a Commonwealth-funded independent scientific review of
air cleaning technologies suitable for effective infection prevention and control in buildings. The ILAQH
centre led by Professor Morawska would be ideally placed to lead such an investigation.


Management of buildings to limit disease spread in future pandemics

Professor Morawska's co-author for the COVID-19 paper is US-based Professor William Bahnfleth, who is
chair of the US committee which has developed the new ASHRAE 241 standard for the control of infectious
aerosols in buildings.6 We wish to draw the inquiries attention to this very important standards as it
establishes the performance measures necessary to limit pathogen spread during a pandemic.

Opira consider that Australia should also seek to adopt a similar standard so that we are ready for the next
pandemic. Rather than close public buildings and shut down economic activity, the adoption of an equivalent

ASHRAE 241 in Australia would allow relatively normal activities to take place during a pandemic and ensure
that building occupants are not exposed to excessive disease risk.

The Australian Standards Committee ME-062 which develops building ventilations standards (AS1668 series)
should be encouraged to adopt an ASHRAE 241-equivalnt standards.

Recommendation 2: That the Commonwealth Government provided the necessary support and funding to
Australian Standards or equivalent standards-setting organisation to develop an Australian version of the
ASHRAE 241 - Control of Infectious Aerosols.
