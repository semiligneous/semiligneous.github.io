                     Dear Members of the COVID-19 Response Inquiry Panel,


                     RE: Suicide Prevention and preparedness for future pandemics


                     Suicide Prevention Australia welcomes the opportunity to provide input to the
                     Commonwealth Government's COVID-19 Response Inquiry. We are the national peak
                     body for the suicide prevention sector. With over 430 members representing more
                     than 140,000 workers, staff, and volunteers across Australia, we provide a collective
                     voice for service providers, practitioners, researchers, local collaboratives, and
                     people with lived experience.

                     We welcome the specific reference to suicide prevention supports in the terms of
                     reference for this inquiry. It is an acknowledgment that pandemics, like other large-
                     scale disasters, can increase the risk of suicide. It's important to note suicide is a
                     complex, multi-factorial human behaviour with many associated risk factors, and so
                     the relationship between the impacts of disasters and suicide risk is complex.


                     Throughout the pandemic Suicide Prevention Australia and the sector it represents
                     have been providing the government with information on the level of distress in the
                     community, and highlighting what the research says about the impacts of epidemics
                     and other disasters. Two key points from the research need to be emphasised:
                          •     Government action can reduce the risk of suicide from disasters
                          •     Suicide rates can rise 2-3 years after a disaster


                     International research on past pandemics such as SARS1 and The Great Influenza2
                     shows a link to increased levels of distress, and previous epidemics have been linked

                     to increased risk of suicide-related outcomes.3,4 During the SARS epidemic in 2003,
                     the suicide rate in Hong Kong reached an unprecedented high (18.6 per 100,000
                     people) from previous years (16.5 per 100,000 people in 2002 and 15.3 per 100,000
                     people in 2001)5,6.


                     Research indicates that the role of increased social supports to combat risk factors
                     for suicide such as financial distress, unemployment and mental health disorders act
                     as protective factors for suicide and as such, increases in suicide rates immediately
                     after disasters are not commonly experienced.3
                                                                  7 However, evidence demonstrates
                                                                  6
                                                                  5
                                                                  4
                     suicide rates can increase years after the disaster which may be attributed to
                     increased disaster supports ending.


                     Disasters and crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic have physical, social and
                     emotional impacts on people and communities who experience them, and last for
                     extended periods of time.8 The link between suicide in the aftermath of disasters is
                     highly evidenced.9 Research based in on US data found rates of suicide to increase
                     during the first 3 years post-disaster,10 and another study found increases in suicide
                     rates were seen 2 years post-disaster.11


                     Based on research and extensive consultation with the sector and with those with
                     lived experience of suicide, Suicide Prevention Australia has made the following
                     recommendations on preparing for future disasters including pandemics:
                           1. Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments budget annually in
                                discretionary funds to respond to need for suicide prevention in the event of
                                future disasters or economic crises, such as bushfires, floods, epidemics for

                            extended time periods after a disaster. These funds should be administered
                            without delay through PHNs, Emergency Management Australia or other
                            mechanisms as required to reach those in need.
                        2. Planning is undertaken to support helplines respond to increasing demands
                            when disasters strike. Additional budgeted discretionary funds should include
                            additional resources for helplines that can be activated as required.
                        3. Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments fund research into
                            population groups to identify at-risk groups vulnerable to disasters to enable
                            development of evidence-based targeted responses which are tailored to
                            diverse demographic, gender, and cultural needs.
                        4. Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments invest in rolling out
                            psychological first aid and suicide prevention training to support communities
                            to identify and support individuals at risk. This should begin with investments
                            to build capability among first-responders, community 'gatekeepers' and
                            other frontline workers who work with communities in the immediate
                            aftermath of a disaster.
                        5. Protective supports, including housing, financial and welfare assistance, put in
                            place during a disaster should be transitioned out in a careful, staged way.
                            This will ensure communities are supported in the medium-term when suicide
                            rates are at risk of increasing.


                     These recommendations are drawn from the Suicide Prevention Australia Policy
                     Position Statement on Disasters. Further details on the evidence behind these
