Submission against Covid Mandates




There are some fundamental truths in the field of Covid and I do not need to elucidate them here or I
would take up more than the three pages maximum allocated to submissions.

Suffice to say that I am reliant upon these well known truths in order to affirm my opposition to the
mandating of Covid vaccines.

No elected Government should impose mandates on its people which put at risk those self same people
through the imposition of those mandates. Lets be clear. The vaccines that we 'had to have', did some of
us a great deal of harm.

This harm manifested itself in attacks on the immune systems of certain groups of people. The results
were a range of induced responses that included but were not limited to, Bell's Palsy (a disfiguring
paralysis of the facial muscles, with long term and sometimes permanent changes). Heart damage was
sustained by another group and the list goes on and on.

The excess deaths, the most reliable indicator of danger, were a clear pointer that sometime was not
right. Having majored in Genetics during my degree, I was not without some understanding in this field.
No vaccine using mRNA technology, should have been released to the public without strenuous testing
of this technology.

Without proper research, a drug can hide its sinister side and once inside people's bodies, it can perform
in unexpected ways. We are not genetically uniform, far from it. We have a range of diversity in our
genetics, that accounts for our differences in height, skin colour etc etc. We are simply our genes
expressing themselves in relation to our environment, our phenotype. The fact that this will vary, is
again an undeniable fact.

This is why vaccines do not and cannot have the same effect on everyone, ever.

The lack of pursuant and dedicated testing of any medication prior to release is tantamount to giving out
poison.

I am 100% against the forced mandating of vaccines and lockdowns
