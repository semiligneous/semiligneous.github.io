To: The COVID-19 Pandemic Response Inquiry

Subject: Response to Terms of Reference for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Inquiry

I hope this letter finds its way to your open-minded consideration, as I express my concern regarding (1) the very
nature of your 'inquiry' into the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the deeply emissive terms of
reference for the inquiry, and (3) the absurdly tight window that has been afforded for responses. Rather than paying
lip service to the nebulous issues and merely constructing a whitewash, this subject demands nothing short of a Royal
Commission and a proper investigation, conducted by adequately unbiased entities who are proven capable of making
fair judgements for that commission. Justice and truth for the people of Australia is required. We do not require
obfuscation, mendacity and more of the unbridled malfeasance and the conducting of international agendas not in the
interest of Australians—which have copiously issued forth by government since early 2020.

Whilst this document might continue to address the current 'inquiry', the call for a Royal Commission remains
paramount—and thus the action of proper investigation will heretofore be referred to as "The Commission", in
reference to the desperately needed and requested Royal Commission on this subject.

While I acknowledge the importance of assessing the handling of the crisis, I find it imperative to highlight several
critical areas that, regrettably, appear to be overlooked in the current framework and that beg consideration. A non­
exhaustive list of these concerns are as follows;

Neglect of Constitutional and Inalienable Rights:
The terms of reference fail to address the egregious violations of fundamental rights endured by citizens during the
pandemic. The imposition of restrictions on the right to travel unrestricted, assemble freely, and visit loved ones,
particularly those in aged care facilities, represents a severe breach of constitutional and inalienable rights. The
requirements made by state governments remain unevidenced, and indeed counter-evidenced as being in any way
useful. A commission must thoroughly investigate these overreaches and their long-term consequences on the
freedom of Australians.

In addition, the commission must address the pressing issue of illegal mandates imposed upon workers by government
bodies and numerous industries, particularly large corporations. Mandates uniformly infringed upon individual
autonomy and personal choice, without due consideration for medical or conscientious objections, or for proper
informed consent, and have raised very serious ethical and legal concerns. The commission should scrutinise the
legality and necessity of such mandates, suggest actions to weigh justice upon the violators of human rights, and
ensure that—in going forward—individual rights are respected and that policies are based on sound evidence rather
than coercion and ill-informed and/or nefarious agendas. The rights and well-being of Australians must not be
sacrificed in the name of expediency, compliance with influential international entities, or industry profits.

Complicity with Pharmaceutical Interests:
The exclusive emphasis on pharmaceutical solutions, notably the controversial 'vaccine', without any substantive
evidence of safety or efficacy (and indeed much counter evidence against the same) raises serious concerns about the
government's alignment with pharmaceutical interests. The commission should critically examine the decision-making
processes that led to the adoption of this injection, considering both its potential toxicity, the lack of supporting
evidence for its utility, and evidences of the premeditated harm of such policy decisions.

Additionally, it is paramount to acknowledge the chilling effect on medical expertise, dissenting from the prevailing
vaccine-centric policies. The overt threat of license removal by AHPRA, an agency supposedly entrusted with
safeguarding professional standards, has created an environment where healthcare practitioners fear retribution for
voicing non-conforming perspectives to the pro-pharmaceutical government narrative. This suppression not only
hampers the free exchange of ideas within the medical scientific community, but also poses a serious ethical concern—
as it impedes the exploration of diverse medical approaches, and potentially limits the pursuit of the most effective
and safest healthcare practices for the Australian population. The Commission must thoroughly examine the role of
AHPRA in stifling dissent. It must ensure that medical professionals are free to contribute their expertise without fear
of reprisal. And it must hold to account the actions of AHPRA, TGA and other entities using illegal and coercive
measures, acting in support of the unsubstantiated narratives of COVID-19 harm, and approving the sole treatment of
an 'experimental' injection whilst secretly knowing of the long list of gravely serious side-effects that recipients would
be potentially subject to, as eventually borne out in the disclosed, US court ordered, Pfizer documents upon their
human test trials.
Amongst many glaring inconsistencies and incoherencies in the government narrative, the commission should also
investigate the very logistic possibility of fulfilling the injection manufacture and supply within the claimed times of
development and manufacture by the industry that supplied said injections; and how counter-evidence denotes the
existence of much pre-'pandemic' knowledge, preparation and manufacture of the biotoxic mRNA injections (including
patents); and that these 'novel' mRNA injections were well known within the specifically relevant scientific community
as able to significantly harm (including the induction of very serious antibody-dependent enhancement, ADE, and
systemic ischemia) by way of a variety of biological mechanisms and toxic ingredients.

Violence and Policing Tyranny:
The actions of the Victorian Government, and to a lesser extent, New South Wales, in deploying "stronger cities" led
UN/Mossad policing tactics against its own citizens, are nothing short of appalling. These tactics of violence were a
serious affront to every Australian, not just to those residing in the states subjected more directly to the police (and
para-military) violence. The commission must scrutinise these instances of violence and tyranny, holding those
responsible accountable for the treasonous behaviour, and the harm inflicted upon innocent civilians in the name of
public health.

Suppression of Viable Treatments and Implementation of the Useless & Harmful:
The deliberate suppression of Ivermectin, a Nobel prize-associated drug, as a viable first-line treatment for COVID-like
illnesses (and also Hydroxychloroquine, and a host of more natural, more efficacious non-toxic treatments for
respiratory illness), raises questions about the government's commitment to evidence-based medicine over
pharmaceutical industry profits. The commission should investigate the reasons behind the dismissal of potentially
effective treatments, the ignoring of much medical evidence from qualified dissident practitioners worldwide, and the
implications of the heavily skewed favouring of inferior solutions over others less lucrative, without any robust
scientific basis.

Equally critical is the need for the inquiry to address the detrimental impact of flawed and proven failed strategies
employed in healthcare settings, including the use of respirators, toxic end-of-life pharmaceuticals such as Midazolam,
inappropriate and often cruel isolation, and the widely mandated yet inefficacious use of masks. The seemingly
coercive application of these measures raises serious concerns about their efficacy and ethical implications. The
Commission should meticulously investigate whether these interventions were driven by genuine health concerns or,
as evidence suggests, were utilised to enforce compliance along a particular agenda. The potential harm caused by
these strategies, both in terms of physical well-being and the manipulation of death statistics for fear propagation,
necessitates a thorough examination. Holding those responsible for the implementation of these measures
accountable is paramount to restoring faith in public health decision-making and ensuring that future strategies
prioritise genuine well-being over questionable agendas.

Responsibility for Increased Mortality:
The alarming increase in all-cause mortality associated with the experimental injection rollout demands immediate
attention. The inquiry must investigate the government's role, including federal agencies such as AHPRA and the TGA,
in the oversight of the rollout and assess the potential adverse effects contributing to the rise in mortality. Secret
documents related to the agreements between governments and pharmaceutical injection suppliers should be
released in full as they should not be hidden from public scrutiny.

Furthermore, urgent attention must be directed towards the profound impact of the forced release by Pfizer, following
a US court order, of scientific data revealing the COVID vaccine's potential harm and lack of efficacy. These revelations,
known to governments, medical institutions, medical authoritative bodies, and the pharmaceutical industry before the
vaccine rollout, underscore a blatant disregard for public safety and informed consent. The inquiry must thoroughly
investigate the extent to which this crucial information was withheld, potentially contributing to the loss of life being
seen in increased all-cause-mortality and the widespread suffering. Holding accountable those responsible for the
suppression of critical data is essential to rebuilding public trust and ensuring transparency in future public health
interventions. The inquiry should prioritise a comprehensive examination of the consequences of such actions on the
well-being of the population and the integrity of public health decision-making processes.

All relevant public health data (of course stripped of individually identifying data) should be released to the Australian
and international public for evaluation of the full extent of harm done by these toxic injections, and the coercive
mandates forcing them upon Australians. The full release of this data and the truth behind this dark chapter of
Australian history will lead to damning evidence against the perpetrators and promoters of this military, psychological,
eugenicist operation against Australians.

Alignment with International Agendas:
The terms of reference inadequately address the influence of international bodies such as the WHO and WEF on
Australian government policies. The inquiry must scrutinise the substitution of health-centric policies with political
agendas outlined in initiatives like Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030. Australians deserve transparency regarding the
motivations behind policy decisions that have impacted their lives, and decimated the economy of Australians and
their future generations.

Moreover, it is imperative to bring attention to the nature of the entire "plandemic" as potentially a military operation,
with the surface operation recognised in the USA as "Operation Warp Speed" (obediently echoed by Australian
Politicians and Bureaucrats). The acknowledgment of this operation as a military psychological campaign against global
populations, particularly within the "Five Eyes" intelligence nations (as revealed by Edward Snowden) demands
thorough investigation. Examining the military's involvement and the extent to which psychological tactics were
employed to shape public perception is crucial in understanding the broader geopolitical context that may have
influenced the government's response. The commission should delve into the motivations behind such operations and
their impact on public trust, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the plandemic's multifaceted origins and
implications.

Mass Media's Role in the "Plandemic" Debacle
Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge and emphasise the need for a thorough inquiry into the mendacious narrative
perpetuated by the controlled mass media. The stifling of open debate and the propagation of a one-sided narrative
has undermined public discourse, hindering the formation of well-informed opinions on the basis of facts. Investigating
the media's role in shaping public perception during the plandemic is essential to understanding how information
dissemination influenced public compliance and decision-making. The subversive influence of mainstream media
outlets, perpetuating a narrow, disinformation based narrative while stifling alternative viewpoints, has undeniably
contributed to a widespread climate of fear and mistrust. This aspect warrants thorough examination within the
Commission, addressing the implications of media collusion with governmental agendas and its impact on public
discourse.

Violation of International Law and Australian Signatory Codes
All of those, whether of private industry or public department, that are responsible for the promotion of counter-
factual establishment narratives, mandates and other coercions and omissions, should be held to account for their
violations against the following international humanitarian laws, patently of significant relevance to the Commission:
a) Hippocratic Oath
b) Declaration of Geneva / World Medical Association,
c) Nuremberg Code
d) Universal Declaration of Human Rights
e) Declaration of Helsinki
f) Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights
g) International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Beings.

Furthermore, the recent attempt to empower ACMA with the authority to regulate free speech is a disconcerting
display of hypocrisy by the federal government. Seeking to suppress dissent by labelling it as "disinformation" and
placing control over communication within the confines of the government narrative is a stark departure from
democratic principles. This dystopic and tyrannical move not only undermines the foundations of free speech but also
sets a dangerous precedent for unchecked government power. The inquiry must scrutinise these attempts to curtail
meaningful dissent, ensuring that democratic values are preserved and that citizens are free to engage in open and
diverse discourse without fear of censorship or reprisal. Upholding the right to dissent is paramount in safeguarding
the democratic fabric of our society against encroachments that echo dystopian and tyrannical tendencies.

In conclusion, I urge the inquiry to expand its scope to thoroughly investigate these critical issues, acknowledging the
gravity of constitutional breaches, pharmaceutical influences, violence against citizens, suppression of viable
treatments, increased mortality, and undue alignment with international agendas. Only through a comprehensive and
unbiased examination can a commission contribute meaningfully to future pandemic response measures.

Thank you for your attention to these crucial matters. I trust that the inquiry will fulfil its duty to the Australian public
with the utmost diligence and integrity and find in favour of the most desperately needed Royal Commission.

Sincerely,

Michael Primero, B.Sc., M.Sc.Soc
