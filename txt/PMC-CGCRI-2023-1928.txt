COVID ENQUIRY COMMISSION

To Whom It May Concern,
I write to you as a concerned Australian citizen that the promise of a full Covid enquiry is not
being met.
The last few years have been very difficult for this country and without an enquiry that looks
at ALL responses, how can you know what the best practice will be the next time.
For 3 years we were told the vaccine would stop transmission.
ie: if you had a vaccine, you were assured you could not pass on the illness.
We now know that was incorrect.
We were told to wear masks, but with many peer reviewed submissions, we now learn masks
are likely to cause illness by breathing in your own breath due to inhaling carbon dioxide.
We were told to keep 1.5 metres apart.
We know learn that was someone’s arbitrary statement and held no credibility.
We were locked down. Again we now know those areas that didn’t lock down had better results
than those that did.
Separating families, unable to see dying relatives.
These abominable directives need to be investigated.
ALL aspects need to be investigated, not cherry picking the ones to incriminate some and not
hold responsible others.
The loss of our Human Rights is something the Government has no right to infringe.
The coercion, the endless announcements, the scaring of the population from something that
was 95% curable.
The stopping of medicines that now are not banned.
We had a preparedness plan that was completely abandoned. WHY???
Without a proper enquiry, you have failed the Australian people.
