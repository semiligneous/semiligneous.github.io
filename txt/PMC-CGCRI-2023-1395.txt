To: The CO VID-19 Response Inquiry Panel

With respect, may I make the following points, which remain of serious concern to
me:

Our fundamental freedoms were severely damaged:
Mandatory vaccines and vaccine passports violated our rights protected by
International Covenants not to be treated without our full and informed consent with
experimental vaccines.

State and territory governments could not have implemented their COVID policies
without the support and endorsement of the federal government.

Yet grave psychological and social harm was done especially to young children and
grave economic harm was done. Severity was understandable at the very beginning
when so little about the virus was known, but social control continued without
justification for far too long. The control was at times gravely discriminatory...some
services were allowed to continue, while Churches and Faith Organisations were
clamped down on.

There should be a Royal Commission, hopefully to prevent all this happening again.
