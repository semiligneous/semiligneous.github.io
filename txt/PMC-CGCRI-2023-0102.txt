Dear COVID-19 Inquiry panel,


My name            I'm ^Hyear oldworking in the energy industry and a concerned
Australian citizen. I would like to seize this opportunity to emphasise the critical need for Australia to
prioritise endeavours aimed at preventing future pandemics, rather than merely preparing for them.


As a young Australian, I have personally felt the profound impact of COVID-19 on various facets of my
life, including education and relationships. It seemed that my demographic, for both social and
economic reasons, was comparatively less equipped to navigate the challenges imposed by the
pandemic.


While this experience has provided me with various perspectives on how governments can assist
individuals and communities, it is evident that even the most well-managed pandemic entails severe
consequences. As such, I strongly believe the primary focus should be on preventing pandemics
altogether.


I've observed that Australia's governments allocate substantial resources to hazard reduction for
other natural disasters, particularly in response to the escalating challenges posed by climate change.
However, I am not aware of a parallel commitment to diminishing the likelihood of pandemics,
despite the seemingly higher risk to the average Australian.


In this context, I wish to highlight several crucial issues that merit attention and consideration to
ensure our collective efforts are directed towards effective pandemic prevention.


Preventing zoonotic diseases
In return for the affordability of meat sourced from factory farms, we witness a stark trade-off - a
surge in bacterial infections, once easily treatable, and an alarming rise in pandemics wreaking havoc
on lives and livelihoods. Factory farms, akin to pressure cookers, become the breeding grounds for
novel pathogens, as highlighted by the UN's projection of a global population reaching 10 billion by
2050. Without transformative shifts in industry or culture, the relentless demand for meat poses an
escalating risk.


The pursuit of inexpensive meat through intensive farming practices hinges on increasing livestock
density. Animals are crammed into factory farms, breathing and defecating in close quarters,
fostering an environment conducive to the emergence of novel pathogens. This density accelerates
the evolution of these pathogens, facilitated by abundant transmission routes. The negative public
health externalities manifest in antimicrobial resistance and the potential for pandemic viruses. The
Inquiry must not condone industries profiting at the expense of endangering lives globally.


Antibiotic overuse in livestock intensifies the problem, with 70% of global antibiotics allocated to
them. Projections suggest a 16% surge in antibiotic usage in Australian farming by 2030, contributing
to global antibiotic resistance. In 2020, antimicrobial resistance in Australia resulted in 1,031 deaths,
$439 million in premature death costs, and the loss of 27,705 quality-adjusted life years. While steps
have been taken to mitigate antimicrobial resistance in livestock, a parallel approach must extend to
combat viruses, the primary catalysts for pandemics.
Viruses with pandemic potential often originate in wildlife but can leap to humans, posing
catastrophic risks. Wildlife hosts viruses harmlessly, but spillover to livestock in farms introduces
novel environments and species, facilitating genetic recombination. This process enhances a virus's
ability to infect and transmit among various hosts, including humans. Proximity in settings like live
markets, animal exports, abattoirs, or factory farms heightens the risk of interspecies transmission,
culminating in the emergence of transmissible viruses. The 2009 MINI flu pandemic, originating in
swine farms in Mexico, exemplifies the dangers of global animal trading.


Australia must mitigate pathogen transmission risks by reducing animal densities in live animal trade,
live exports, and factory farming. Biosecurity strategies should mandate practical measures to curb
these risks, and if prevention proves too costly or risky, Australia has a responsibility to cease
practices contributing to pandemics and antimicrobial resistance.


The late Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an eminent infectious disease control expert, emphasised
the imperative to halt live animal trade. Australia must surpass this prediction, embracing policies
that safeguard against future pandemics and prevent the slow march towards antimicrobial
resistance.


Preventing engineered pandemics
An imperative facet of pandemic prevention that merits heightened consideration in Australia is the
burgeoning threat of engineered pandemics. The Inquiry's terms of reference underscore the
importance of anticipating future pandemics, and compelling evidence indicates that effective
preparation necessitates a proactive approach to this potentiality.


Leading experts, including MIT Professor Kevin Esvelt, caution that the technologies essential for
designing, creating, and releasing perilous and unprecedented pathogens could become widely
accessible by 2025. The Geneva Security report titled "Delay, Detect, Defend: Preparing for a future
in which thousands can release new pandemics" expounds on this concern (refer to Figure 1).


In 2021, Professor Brian Schmidt AC, Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, expressed
profound apprehension about the "democratisation" of biotechnology, foreseeing the imminent
availability of mass-market printers capable of manipulating DNA. The fear extends beyond hijacking
existing diseases to the creation of entirely novel ones. The subsequent surge in the market for
synthetic DNA, specialty reagents, and Al tools amplifies the urgency of addressing this pressing
issue.


The prospect of a large and diverse group, whether malicious or not, wielding a technology with the
potential to cause mass casualties is unequivocally an unacceptable risk. Acknowledging this peril,
President Biden issued an executive order on October 30, 2023, mandating the development of a
framework within 180 days. This framework focuses on effective screening for risky DNA sequences,
best practices for access controls, technical guidance for screening, and robust oversight
mechanisms. Currently, approximately 20% of DNA orders undergo no screening, and
non-compliance post the stipulated timeline could result in funding cuts.
Australia, which already has a permitting regime governing the importation of synthetic DNA, should
urgently align with the United States in updating this regime. The Inquiry should recommend that
labs importing DNA into Australia adhere to the new screening procedures outlined in the US
executive order.


While swift action following the US model will address immediate risks highlighted by Professors
Esvelt and Schmidt, it is not a lasting solution. Ongoing advancements in biotechnology and
increasingly sophisticated Al may enable nefarious users to circumvent regulations unless regulatory
frameworks evolve in tandem. To this end, the Inquiry should advise the Department of Industry to
collaborate with the Department of Health and the CDC in formulating minimum safety standards for
frontier models deployed in Australia. This includes identifying and restricting models with biosafety
risks, setting explicit expectations for developers and deployers, and vigilantly monitoring
biotechnological advancements to prevent the widespread accessibility of engineered pathogens.



Throughout history, pivotal public health issues have been overcome through the ingenuity of
individuals who brought fresh ideas and perspectives to the realm of health challenges. As the
landscape of public health has expanded, so too has its capacity to enhance both longevity and the
quality of life.


The essence of this inquiry's terms of reference lies in the pursuit of improvement for the future.
Considering the potential severity of future pandemics, the most impactful course of action for the
Inquiry is to prioritize pandemic prevention, encompassing a thorough examination of novel ways in
which pandemics might unfold in the years to come. While this necessitates grappling with
uncomfortable considerations regarding unforeseen topics and emerging technologies, it is precisely
these issues that have the potential to wield the most significant influence in securing a healthier
and more resilient future.
