Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Submission t the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry Panel



                                                       11 continue to be appalled by the Australian
Government and Public Service's response to COVID-19 and urge the COVID-19 Response Inquiry
Panel to recommend a Royal Commission to properly investigate and rectify the many failings,
injustices, and irregularities that occurred during that shameful episode and, indeed, continue to
occur (here listed for brevity):

•    Government neglected to implement the 2019 Australian Health Management Plan for
     Pandemic Influenza.
•    TGA promoted the use of the RT-PCR test with a high cycle threshold for COVID-19 diagnosis,
     failed to investigate reports of vaccine injury and death, hid deaths, and lied in senate estimates.
•    TGA & Office of the Gene Technology Regulator failed to properly review the evidence from the
     vaccine trials and failed to properly regulate novel mRNA technologies.
•    AHPRA censored the health profession and interfered in the doctor-patient relationship.
•    Government collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on COVID-19 infection,
     hospitalisation, vaccination, and vaccine injury was incomplete, insufficient, and inconsistent.
•    Government imprudently procured large amounts of vaccines with secret contracts and conflicts
     of interest with manufacturers repeatedly convicted of serious crimes including fraudulent
     marketing and bribery.
•    Government health messaging was excessive, inaccurate, dishonest, politicised, fear-mongering,
     and incited division among families and communities in order to maximise medical procedures
     despite clear signs of harm and ineffectiveness.
•    Government colluded with the private sector to shape and censor public discourse.
•    Government failed to intervene in civil and human rights violations perpetrated by the states and
     private sector (e.g., mask mandates, lockdowns, lockouts, suppression of protests, construction
     of 'covid camps', vaccine mandates, suppression of treatments and medications).
•    Government failed to protect workplace rights against unfair workplace mandates, failures to
     consult workers, failures to conduct proper risk assessments, and unfair dismissals.
•    Government failed to acknowledge or investigate widespread serious vaccine injuries and
     deaths, including a drastic increase in excess all-cause mortality.

Thank you for the opportunity to express my views.

Yours faithfully
