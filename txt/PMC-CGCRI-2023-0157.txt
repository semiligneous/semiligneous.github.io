I want to submit a response requesting a proper Royal Commission for a proper
investigation into; corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts; mask mandates; lock
downs; vaccine mandates, official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability
of vaccines to block transmission, vaccine injuries; media censorship, silencing of doctors,
the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors, and the poor
treatment of victims. A full royal commission is needed as our country and others are seeing
the deadly outcomes from this covid rubbish and the Government seem to do nothing and
are not being held accountable.
