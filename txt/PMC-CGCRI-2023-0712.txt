Members of the Panel
Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry



Dear Panel Members

I write as a member of the public who has been very concerned at the governmental
response to the COVID-19 pandemic over the past 3 years.

I strongly urge you to thoroughly investigate:
•   the vaccine procurement contracts,
•   official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of the vaccines to block
    transmission,
•   media censorship,
•   the silencing of the medical fraternity,
•   the role of AHPRA, ATAGI and the TGA in the assessment of and mandating of the
    vaccines.

Please conduct an unbiased, fair and truthful inquiry in order to restore the trust of citizens
such as myself.

Yours sincerely
