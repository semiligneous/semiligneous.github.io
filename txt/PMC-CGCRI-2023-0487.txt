As a concerned citizen I respectfully request a full Royal Commission for a proper
investigation into:

   1.     Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts
   2.     Vaccine mandates
   3.     Vaccine injuries
   4.     Mask mandates and lockdowns
   5. Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
      infection and transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gaslighting of the
      injured
   6. The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable harm of the
      vaccine and their action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical Profession.

The impact that still reverberates throughout Australia has affected so many people and
businesses on so many different levels. Whilst the government of the day responded
inappropriately in many instances there has been little to no follow through/up amongst the
citizenry. In fact we have had to go begging, hat in hand to get phycological, medical [long
covid] and financial support in the months since all the facades have been dropped. This also
requires full and proper investigation and open reporting.
