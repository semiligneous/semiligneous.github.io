            Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

To the Members of the Independent Panel,


I am writing this submission to voice concerns over certain aspects of Australia's response to the COVID-19

pandemic. While I recognise the importance of the Inquiry's goal to improve pandemic preparedness, there are

critical areas that require thorough scrutiny.



Concerns Over Specific Pandemic Measures



Mask and Vaccine Mandates: The implementation of mask and vaccine mandates had significant impacts on

individual freedoms and social dynamics. These measures, often invasive, warrant a detailed review to assess

their necessity, effectiveness, and proportionality.



Lockdowns and Curfews: The economic, social, and psychological impacts of lockdowns and curfews have

been profound. An evaluation of these measures is essential to understand their long-term effects on Australian

society and whether they were the most appropriate response.



Communication Strategies: It is quite clear that there was an unwarranted use of fear in public health

messaging. It's important to analyse whether such communication strategies were effective or whether they

contributed to unnecessary panic and distress among the public.



Concerns Over the Composition and Scope of the Inquiry



Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have previously expressed support for

certain pandemic measures raises questions about the objectivity and impartiality of the Inquiry. Panel members

who have expressed support for such measures should recuse themselves.



Exclusion of Unilateral State and Territory Government Decisions: One of the most significant omissions in

the Inquiry's scope is the exclusion of actions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments. These

decisions, including state-imposed lockdowns and border controls, were pivotal to the nation's pandemic

response and should be included in the Inquiry.



The Need for a Comprehensive Review


While          is of Reference for the Inquiry are extensive, it is crucial that the above-mentioned areas are not

overlooked. A truly comprehensive review should encompass all aspects of the government's response, including

those currently outside the Inquiry's scope. They are the elephant’s in the room.

Conclusion


This submission represents a collective call for a more inclusive and thorough investigation into Australia's

abysmal and deadly COVID-19 response. It also urges for freedom and liberty to not ever be cast aside with

fearmongering as it was by Australian governments during the pandemic. We urge the Inquiry to consider these

points to ensure transparency, accountability, and the safeguarding of Australian values and liberties.


Background

The COVID-19 pandemic saw unprecedented measures that, in many cases, tipped the scales toward what I felt
was a tyrannical overreach of government authority to what is provably a grandiose, criminal fraud at every level.

Our civil liberties and freedoms, which we hold dear, were suspended under the guise of public health.

There was no pandemic. There was no emergency. It was all smoke and mirrors. It was fraud and deception.



Casting a Critical Eye on the Inquiry

Firstly, it needs to be said that the aspects of the inquiry itself are troubling.

Some of its chairs have previously expressed support for the very measures that majority of us found oppressive.

This apparent bias raises questions about the inquiry's ability to objectively evaluate the government's response
and recommend meaningful changes. Seriously. The Inquiry’s objectivity is compromised before it starts.

The persons in question should identify themselves, explain their support for the draconian measures imposed on
the Australian people, explain the degree to which they are compromised or corrupted and recuse themselves from
their positions on the panel of Inquiry on the grounds of their historical, easily proven bias.

Moreover, the inquiry's scope is notably limited, omitting a crucial element of the pandemic response: the actions
taken unilaterally by state and territory governments.

These decisions, which profoundly affected our daily lives and freedoms, should be central to any comprehensive
review of the pandemic response.

Their exclusion from the Inquiry's scope is a glaring, purposeful, damning oversight, leaving a significant gap in the
evaluation of Australia's overall handling of the so called crisis. There was no crisis. It was a fabricated crisis.

If the plandemic, Scamdemic, Casedemic were indeed a real pandemic like the bubonic plague [which was
introduced into Europe as Saracen bioweapon and spread by that eras doctors for fees for protection and cure],
I’m sure no stone would be left unturned in getting to the bottom of the dystopian, dysfunctional and tyrannical
abuses committed by the Australian state governments and their agencies from 2020 - present, which includes a
complete lack of remorse for the injuries, deaths and crushing financial results of those actions.


The Urgency of my Submission

Nonetheless, this inquiry is still a chance to scrutinise and question the actions taken by all governments during
the pandemic. It was a depopulation exercise in serious planning for some 30-40 years. The historical documents
attest to that. None of the operation was kept secret from the public. One only has to purchase Agenda 21, a
document published by the UN from Amazon to see that this is the case. All the published World Economic Forum
documents attest to the same. Our Prime Ministers attended annual WEF meetings. The patents paper trail for the
covid 19 jabs, which go back to 1998 need to be studied. As do the published research papers for the myriad
injectable technologies found in the C19 jabs. As do the ‘Covid 19’ PCR test importation documents for lots
imported into Australia in 2015 and 2018 under that description; 5 and 3 years prior to the naming of ‘Covid 19’ by
the WHO in early 2020.

All this needs to be considered. The information mentioned is readily available and highly qualified researchers of
international repute, some of them Australian; are available to provide expert testimony to all of it.

The decisions that led to lockdowns, curfews, and mandates drastically altered ourway of life, impacting everything
from our basic freedoms to our economic wellbeing.

These measures, while intended to protect, have left lasting scars on our society and individual lives. A large
number of those lives cut short by the devastating effects of the C19 jabs.

My Voice & Will Against Overreach

The inquiry's current scope and panel composition have raised concerns about its ability to fully address the depth
and breadth of all the issues at hand.

Crucially, actions taken unilaterally by state governments are not included.

So I’m suggesting to the inquiry that a new thorough inquiry needs to be held to correct this oversight. This is where
my submission becomes indispensable.

By submitting my views, I’m advocating for a more thorough and unbiased examination of the pandemic response,
including areas this inquiry currently overlooks. This inquiry should recommend an unrestricted Royal Commission.

Impact of My Participation

My submission is a testament to the democratic process.

It's a statement that the voices of the Australian people matter and should be heard, especially in times of crisis.
And especially in times of review of responses to that crisis, and the impact of those irresponsible, unjustifiable,
and apparently unaccountable actions taken by those who are/were in positions of power to protect us, assist us
and guide us through such a crisis. The people in power filling those roles were on no use or protection to the
Australian people at all. They supported the plandemic depopulation fraud, a gigantic, global, orchestrated fraud in
‘Lockstep’ executed on a global scale . They aided and abetted a crime so monstrous that it is amazing that they
thought they would successfully get away with it. And it looks very likely that they will get away with it if Inquiries
like this one are permitted to whitewash their criminal actions.

This is about more than just reviewing the past; it's about setting a precedent for how we, as a nation, respond to
future crises. Do we permit propaganda, banning of effective, safe, cheap, available remedies, banning of real
science, of coercive misinformation and disinformation campaigns by ‘our’ governments and their agencies against
us, we the people who elect them, pay their wages and suffer as result of their criminal actions?

I will not allow our rights to be overshadowed by emergency measures again. I will stand up and demand
accountability and a balanced approach that respects our freedoms. I will not comply ever again.

The Weight of Our Words

Each submission, including mine, carries weight.

It's a line in the sand to the authorities that overstepped the mark, a testament to the hardships we all endured,
and a plea fora more balanced and respectful approach in the future. This needs to be acknowledged.

It's about ensuring that our government remembers that even in times of crisis, the preservation of freedom and
liberty and the supremacy of the Australian Constitution is absolutely paramount.


Please Act Now

The pandemic's measures have left an indelible mark on our society.

Our trust in government, in ‘health’ which I will describe here as ‘sickness maintenance for profit and career
enhancement’ - epidemic-pandemic policy, government agencies and departments captured by the private­
corporate interests they supposedly regulate [this includes the UN, the WHO, UNESCO, the World Bank et al, the
US FDA, the US CDC, the Australian TGA, the US DoD, the US Dept of Justice]..., our trust in these NGOs and
government agencies and departments that we own, that we pay for is beyond repair. The illusion has been
shattered, destroyed. We the general public have had our slumber broken. We are awake, wondering what’s next?

Now is the time for this Inquiry to reflect, critique, and demand better. Criminal referrals should be made.

I make this submission to ensure that my voice, my Will as a constituent, and shareholder in the Commonwealth
of Australia and our collective voices lead to a future where our freedoms are not so easily compromised again.

Yours Sincerely,

Graham King
