Call for submissions and evidence to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

https://www.pmc.gov.au/covid-19-response-inquiry/consultation



As a concerned Australian citizen, I call for an immediate Royal Commission into the mishandling of
the COVID pandemic by our elected Government and our non-elected Government bureaucrats.

Ares of concern are:

    1.         Corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts

    2.         Vaccine mandates violating our basic human rights

    3.     Official misinformation, disinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of the
           vaccines to block transmission and prevent infection

    4.         Suppressed data regarding vaccine injuries and deaths

    5.         Media censorship of alternate viewpoints to the official science

    6.     Silencing of Doctors and the mis-treatment of hospital inpatients following suppression of
           clinical studies showing alternate treatment methods

    7.         The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of Doctors

    8.         The poor treatment of vaccine injured victims
