To whom it may concern,

As a former registered health professional, I share the concerns of a scientifically -literate
and well-educated portion of the community that demands a proper Royal Commission for a
comprehensive independent investigation into: vaccine procurement and confidential
contracts; PCR testing and accuracy, testing and approval of experimental injections , mask
and injection mandates, lock-downs, media censorship, government-endorsed
discrimination, denial of access to safe and effective treatments, injuries and reporting,
compensation, policing, excess deaths, etc.

In order to restore public faith in an apparently incompetent and unaccountable
bureaucracy, the Independent panel should be appointed from within the community not
by the government - given that this is fundamentally an investigation into Government
performance.

The independent panel should seek submissions from independent:

-immunologists, respiratory physicians and epidemiologists
-data analysts
-human rights lawyers/solicitors
-small business owners affected/financially ruined by government 'emergency' measures
-independent pharmaceutical experts
-Undertakers and coroners
-Statisticians and actuaries
-Economists such as|

The failure of the government to recognise The Great Barrington Declaration - as promoted
by internationally recognised infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists,
needs to be explained as does the departure from previously accepted public health
guidelines, https://gbdeclaration.org/

The proposed Terms of Reference are completely inadequate to restore public faith in the
impartial representation of those in public office including politicians, bureaucrats, advisory
'experts' and regulatory bodies, https://brownstone.org/articles/state-power-and-covid-
crimes-part-1/

The impact of Covid-19 was negligible in our small community, however the impact of
Authoritarian government policies is still being felt nationwide. Unless the scope of terms of
reference for the Covid-response inquiry are expanded to include the actions taken by state
and territory governments this whole performance will be another monumental waste of
tax-payers money. There should be no amnesty for the perpetrators.

Sincerely,
