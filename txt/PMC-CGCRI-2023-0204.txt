Covid Inquiry-Jane Dempsey

I was a full-time grade one teacher in the Northern suburbs of Melbourne in 2021. Due to
the covid vaccine mandates, which I refused to take, I lost my job. It was my first year of
teaching as a mature age graduate. I was devastated at not being able to teach for 9 months.
This included social ostracization, no pay and my holiday pay was also denied.

No-one should ever have to choose between protecting their health and their job and
means of earning a living. These vaccines have no evidence of long-term safety and have
caused harm (and death) to so many people who took them. Australia's excess death rate is
up at nearly 20% since 2021 - and this is not from covid deaths. This needs to be
investigated.

In terms of future pandemic preparedness - mandating vaccines should never be applied
again. It did nothing but cause division and suffering. The vaccines did not stop the spread of
covid or even reduce symptoms. The unvaccinated did not clog up the hospital system - in
fact we are the healthiest ones now. We did not suffer excessively when we contracted
covid. I hope you will consider these points and ensure that Australia does not have to go
through such dark times again.

Thank you,

Jane Dempsey
