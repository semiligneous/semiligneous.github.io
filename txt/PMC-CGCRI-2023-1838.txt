On August 13th, 2021 I had my one and only Pfizer vaccine. Within two weeks of this my world came
crashing down to say the least. I had a range of symptoms such as fatigue, migraines, vertigo, nausea,
muscle pain, jolts, diarrhoea, dizziness, blood pooling in my feet, insomnia etc. The list is endless.

I had a 4 week old at the time and even since then I have been unable to be the hands on parent I always
wanted.

I have now been diagnosed with ME/CFS and POTS. Both in the extreme category. I can no longer walk or
stand up, and use an electric power wheelchair to get around the house. I am bedbound for the majority
of the day.

I have been unable to work since the vaccine and have placed my teaching registration on hold due to
my debilitating illness.

Two of my treating neurologists have confirmed that my extremely poor health is due to my one and
only vaccine.

There is no cure and treatment for my conditions, my quality of life is poor and bleak.

I have lost all my social connections and friends have gone from my life due to my disability. My marriage
is strained and both my older child misses their old mum.

Financially it has also hit a toll, with having carers come in to look after my now toddler.
