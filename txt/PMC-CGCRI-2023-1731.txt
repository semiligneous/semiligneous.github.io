Re: The impact of vaccination enforcement undertaken by the Australian Federal
Government during the COVID 19 pandemic


Evidence presented by Dr John Campbell (https://www.youtube.eom/@Campbellteaching), Dr
Norman Fenton (https://www.youtube.eom/@NormanFenton81 ) and many others have shown
the Covid vaccines were ineffective in stopping transmission, reducing severity of illness, and
reducing deaths. The vaccines also caused injuries at high levels. In brief, the covid vaccines
were an extreme failure of medical practice.


Therefore, the enforcement of vaccine adoption also became an extreme failure of public health
policy. A failure that lies primarily with the Australian Federal Government.


If the federal government had not provided the state governments access to the Australian
Immunisation Register state governments would not have had the capacity to run riot with
coercive regulations that ruined the livelihoods and health of many Australians.


Coercive vaccination policies have no place in a liberal democracy and the Australian Federal
Government needs to stop assisting the poor medical practice of state governments.
