                                      Covid 19 Response Inquiry Submission

       The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 3) states: “Human dignity, human rights and
    fundamental freedoms are to be fully respected (and the) interests and welfare of the individual should
                         have priority over the sole interest of science or society”.

My name i:                                           primary school teacher. I was relieved of my role in
January 2022, due to the COVID vaccination requirement... I felt devastated that I was persecuted for a
choice that was rightfully mine to make. My decision cost me my freedom to work and fully participate in
society...But what most people didn't know was that my decision was based on the very near loss of my
daughter after receiving a Covid vaccine...the same vaccine that public health messaging kept touting was
both 'safe and effective'. The doctors who revived my daughter would not record her adverse event as
being related to the vaccine due to AHPRA's gag on medical professionals, the one that prevents them
from speaking negatively regarding the COVID vaccines! I


Though my daughter survived, she now worries what her future holds as a result of having this vaccine. She
wonders if she will be able to have children and if she will have health problems related to having had it.
These are valid concerns as these vaccines have not been properly tested and there is no long term safety
data forthem (Thacker, 2021; https://www.ncirs.org.au/phases-clinical-trials;
https://www.voutube.com/watch?v=2yjzAxKZvWI ).



Public health messaging implied that those who declined to have the COVID vaccines were part of the
problem, our government turned our fellow Australians against each other! The COVID vaccines did NOT
stop people contracting or transmitting the virus, as is stated on the Australian Government health website
(     https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/i5-it-true/is-it-true-how-long-does-it-take-for-
the-vaccines-to-work). As such, the public health messaging should never have stated that these vaccines
are 'safe and effective'.     At no point were any public health messages, mandates, possible treatment
protocols or lock downs available to be debated...we were simply told.... Debate promotes problem solving
and innovative thinking, and pandemics are when such thinking is required.

Key points:


        1.           Public health messaging should always be factual, and open to debate.

        2. Vaccine and mask mandates should never have been pushed on the people of Australia -
           recommendations can be made, but it should be up to each individual to make their own
           decision, and they should be able to do so without fear of retribution/consequences.
           Masks do not prevent transmission or contraction of viruses (Rancourt, 2020).
           Covid-19 vaccines do not stop people contracting or transmitting the virus (Binkin et al, 2021;
              Brown et al, 2021; Keehner et al., 2021; Public Health England, 2021; Riemersma et al., 2021;
              Servellita et al, 2021; Subramanian et al, 2021).



        3. The Commonwealth Government funding provided to each state and territory for their COVID
           response should have required that every Australian's human rights were not disregarded, in
           order to ensure that Australians were did not lose their basic human rights.

        4. Lockdowns should never be employed - if people want to stay home, let them, but if people
           want to continue going about their lives, they should be free to do so.
5. Public health messaging should always include information on how to improve the immune
   system through adequate sleep, good nutrition, exercise etc. not just focus on one aspect of
   the health issue.

6. Accurate recording of cause of death and hospitalisation so statistics are useful and accurate
   instead of alarmist.

The statistics are a joke! The number of COVID deaths was hugely inflated due to the fact that a
person may have died from a heart attack, but had tested positive for covid sometime in the past
few weeks (though was completely unrelated to the heart attack), so that death was then recorded
as a COVID death!!! How this is was allowed to happen is beyond me! The same occurred with
hospitalisation data, if a patient was admitted for something completely unrelated to COVID, but
they had tested positive up to 6 or more weeks earlier, their hospitalisation was recorded as a
COVID hospitalisation! !!! Yet more evidence that the public were not being given a clear picture of
what was actually going on!! And the public, the people of Australia, have a right to know accurate
information!!!



7. Suggestions can be made regarding possible medical interventions that may or may not be
   beneficial, but individual choice should be private, confidential and not affect an Australian's
   ability to work, socialise or participate in everyday life.
8. Freedom of choice regarding medical procedures should always be central to decision making
    (meaning no negative repercussions as a result of a medical choice)...

       The people of Australia have been let down by the Commonwealth Government's
        response to the COVID pandemic. Many of us lost our freedoms, our ability to earn
       a living and our ability to participate fully in society. Sweden did not impose such
       draconian measures and yet they recorded among the lowest excess mortality
        rates. Therefore taking away personal freedoms did not = better outcomes!



9. Vaccine passports should never be allowed - they encourage discrimination, segregation and
   a culture that hands our rights over to an app.

10. All government decisions should be open to debate as it provides a platform for having
    discussions on critical issues facing the world...debate brings about improvement, therefore
    creating a better world.



The Commonwealth Government failed to ensure personal freedoms, including bodily autonomy,
were safeguarded during the pandemic. The Commonwealth Government funded the pandemic
response of each state and territory-the funding should have come with strings attached, i.e. ensure
personal freedoms, bodily autonomy, freedom of speech, the right to demonstrate, the right to work
etc. should all have been ensured!!

I was one of many who was unable to earn a living due to absurd mandates!! The way I and so many
others were treated was absolutely disgusting!! Yet no person in a position of power, including our
Prime Minister, stood up and said, NO! No government should have the power to lock people down,
enforce absurd mandates that if not followed have dire consequences such as loss of income, loss of
the ability to socialise, loss of the ability to leave one's home unless for a limited list of 'acceptable'
reasons!!
            Annual Australian road deaths exceed C OVID deaths throughout the pandemic, yet we don't
           stop everyone from driving, nor should we! (Australian Bureau of Statistics - see reference list).

In short, the lockdowns and vaccine mandates negatively impacted both me and my family's mental health,
some of us are still trying to recover.

Me and many other Australians now have little if any trust in our government or the medical profession I

Future pandemic responses should NOT impede our basic human rights - freedom to move about freely,
freedom to work to earn a living, freedom of choice regarding medical procedures etc.

Future pandemic responses should NOT include inaccurate public health messaging.

Future public health messaging should NOT turn Australians against each other.

Future pandemic responses should NOT take people's jobs from them.

Future pandemic responses should NOT take trained medical professionals away from their jobs based on
their own medical decisions! (This decision during the COVID pandemic meant that hospitals which were
already suffering an understaffing problem, then experienced an even bigger staff problem, even though
there were many staff members who were ready and willing, however the vaccine mandate prevented them
from doing so.)

Future pandemic responses should NOT allow people to be discriminated against based on their medical
choices.

Future pandemic responses SHOULD allow for freedom of choice, and should not allow any kind of coercion.

Future pandemic responses should encourage medical professionals to discuss the positives and negatives
of any and all treatments, vaccines, medications etc. without fear of retribution!!
