COVID Submission: Government Failure and Betrayal




Introduction:

The Australian federal government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has not only been
inadequate but has also led to severe consequences, including the unnecessary loss of thousands of
lives. The government's mismanagement, declaration of a pandemic when there wasn't one,
banning of effective therapeutics, inappropriate use of diagnostic tests, and the censorship of
doctors have all contributed to this devastating outcome. This submission aims to shed light on
these failures and the dire consequences they have had on the Australian population.




1. The Pandemic Controversy:

The true rate of death from COVID-19 remains uncertain, as there are conflicting reports and
suspicions of misattributed deaths. It is essential to ascertain the accurate mortality rate to better
comprehend the magnitude of the threat posed by the virus and implement appropriate measures
accordingly. Moreover, it is crucial to investigate whether the high mortality rate during the
pandemic was a result of hospital failures or the use of ineffective treatments such as Remdesivir.
Scrutinizing these factors will help determine the culpability of the authorities in the loss of lives.




Additionally, the question of virus isolation arises. It is imperative to identify those accountable for
the task of isolating the virus and whether any conflicts of interest existed within the process. This
includes examining the appropriate use and accuracy of diagnostic tests such as PCR and RAT tests.1
The misuse or flawed implementation of these tests can lead to inaccurate case numbers,
misdiagnoses, and distorted perceptions of the pandemic's severity. Investigating the
appropriateness and reliability of these tests will provide valuable insights into the government's
handling of the pandemic.




2. Treatable Disease with Safe Therapeutics:

The decision to ban effective therapeutics like Ivermectin2 and Hydroxychloroquine3 raises serious
concerns. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence supporting the effectiveness of these drugs

in treating COVID-19. Yet, the Australian government chose to disregard this evidence, denying
patients potential life-saving treatments. Additionally, the discouragement of essential supplements
like Vitamin D, Zinc, and Vitamin C by the National Taskforce raises further questions about their
intentions and the scientific basis of their recommendations. Were these decisions influenced by
external interests? Were there experts with diverse perspectives involved in devising these
guidelines?

Furthermore, the use of Remdesivir as a treatment option must be carefully examined.3
studies have shown that Remdesivir may cause renal failure and can potentially lead to deaths. If
patients died as a result of Remdesivir treatment, it is crucial to quantify and acknowledge the
number of fatalities caused by this drug. Failure to do so would indicate a lack of accountability on
the part of the authorities and a disregard for patient safety.




3. Vaccine Promotion and Lack of Long-Term Safety Data:

The government's relentless push for vaccines as the only viable solution is concerning, particularly
considering the limited availability of long-term safety data. While acknowledging the importance of
vaccination in combating the spread of COVID-19, it is essential to consider the potential risks and
ensure transparency regarding vaccine safety. Neglecting to address public concerns about vaccine
side effects and dismissing alternative treatment options unnecessarily limits individuals' freedom of
choice in managing their health.




4. AHPRA's Targeting of Doctors:

The suspension and targeting of doctors, such as those using Ivermectin off-label, is deeply
troubling. Off-label use of medications, including Ivermectin, is a legitimate medical practice.
Punishing doctors for prescribing drugs with a potential to save lives undermines medical autonomy
and stifles innovation in treatments. A thorough investigation is required to evaluate the actions of
AHPRA and to ensure that doctors can provide the best possible care to their patients without fear
of retribution.




Conclusion:

The Australian federal government's mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic has had
devastating consequences for the public. The failure to accurately assess the pandemicâ€™s severity,
the banning of effective therapeutics, the inappropriate use of diagnostic tests, the exclusive focus
on vaccines as the only solution, and the targeting of doctors using off-label treatments have all led
to unnecessary deaths and suffering. It is clear that the government's approach to the pandemic is

deeply concerning, and there is a need for another inquiry to uncover the truth and hold those
responsible accountable. The Australian people deserve to know the truth and to understand the
reasons behind the government's actions. People need to be held accountable for the unnecessary
loss of lives. A thorough investigation is necessary to prevent such failures in the future, prioritize
scientific evidence, promote transparency, and restore public trust in the government's response to
health crises.
