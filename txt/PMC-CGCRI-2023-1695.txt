Hi, my thoughts on the Covid response are:

1. The vaccines were still experimental, particularly the mRNA
vaccines, and so no recipient of a vaccine inoculation could, prima
facie, be said to be fully informed. Neither the long-term effects
nor the full suite of side effects had been established.

2. The data in the national vaccine side-effect reporting system
has not yet been fully researched. The data should be made
available to analysts independent of the medical institutions. It is
unlikely that all side-effects have been recorded due to lack of
time or inclination of the medical practitioner.

3. AHPRA went beyond its remit by thinly veiled threats to
medical practitioners if they discouraged patients from taking a
Covid vaccine. AHPRA broke the nexus between doctor and
patient. The patients were left on their own and had to make their
own judgment about the efficacy of the experimental vaccines.
AHPRA caused doctors to break the Hippocratic oath, ‘First Do
No Harm’.

4. The Medical Authorities were too quick to disavow tried and
tested anti-viral treatments. It is noted that much later they
quietly allowed Ivermectin to be prescribed. This ‘vaccine only’
ethos of the Medical Authorities gave the impression that they
there were in the pocket of Big Pharma.

5. State health departments were allowed too much free rein to
impose their Vaccine Mandates. The Federal Government could
have done more to proscribe principles to the States. It was
dreadful that so many employees were subject to ‘No Jab, No
Job’ dictates from their employers.

 My wife and I took one dose of the            vaccine. My wife
developed heart palpitations 3 hours later and had further heart
palpitations 3 days later. I caught Covid 3 weeks after the
^^^^|dose and 2 % weeks later developed a blood clot in my
lower left calf. Was the clot caused by either Covid, the^^^^H
dose, or both? Neither of us returned for the second dose.
Anecdotally, there are many instances of vaccine injury. The^|
year old son of one^^^^^^^^^^|woman died after
vaccination. Two brothers-in-law of my youngest brother had
DVTs. An associate in a political party had neurological reactions.
