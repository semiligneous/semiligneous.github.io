                              SUBMISSION RE COVID19 INQUIRY

In addressing the call for submissions for the Covid Inquiry from the Office of Prime Minister
and Cabinet, the issues needed to be investigated are as follows:

   •   Transparency in covid contracts between organizations including pharmaceutical
       companies
   •       Vaccine data on mortality rates
   •       Mask mandates
   •       Lockdowns
   •       Misinformation in media regarding the ability of vaccines to block transmissions
   •       Vaccine injuries
   •       Media censorship relating to vaccines and their effects
   •   Silencing of doctors and other qualified personnel such as independent scientists,
       epidemiologists and the like
   •       The lack of openness for scientific and medical debate
   •   The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors poor treatment of
       vaccine injured victims
   •       The harassment of family members by hospitals
   •       Border closures preventing families seeing their loved ones, sick or not

My husband and I were directly impacted by the lockdowns both losing our jobs, I was pregnant
at the time, and had a harrowing experience being outcasted and mistreated by family
members and friends and the wider community, due to the awful divisive narrative that was
being forecasted by the Government and media. I was unable to attend my grandmothers 90th
birthday and spend Christmas with loved ones as we were seen as a danger to the people
around us. We lost my husbands grandmother and had not seen her in months due to strict
mandates on travel restrictions. This caused us horrific stress, this stress impacted my
pregnancy and ended up having a stillbirth in the emergency department                   hospital
                we did not receive adequate treatment or care from staff, due to hospital beds
needed to be put aside for covid patients. We have since put in a complaint and since
apologized.

We aren't the only ones that were discriminated against. The whole covid experience was heart
breaking for the people of Australia.

Governments and affiliates MUST be investigated. A Royal Commission Inquiry into Covid is
required and demanded by the people of Australia to be held accountable and an apology is
desperately NEEDED.
