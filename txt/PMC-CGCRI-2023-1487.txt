Dear Officer,

My name is Laine Jolly and until early 2022,1 had been a registered nurse in Australia for 14 years. After repeated
but unsuccessful attempts to engage in good-faith dialogue with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation
Agency (AHPRA) and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA), as well as numerous politicians,
health bureaucrats and medical regulators, I made the difficult decision to surrender my professional nursing
registration in objection to grossly the governments' unethical covid response policy which has been facilitated,
in part, by my former profession.

There are many harmful areas of our governments' and health bureaucracies' covid response which I believe
must be thoroughly examined in order to mitigate further harm and prevent similarly damaging decisions in the
future.

To summarise, these issues include (but are not limited to):

- significant and inexplicable deviations from established pandemic guidance as recently updated as 2019,
including (but not limited to) the unsupported use of lockdowns, school closures, community masking,
mandatory adult vaccination, broadscale childhood vaccination, and the unforgivable separation of loved ones
dying in hospital and/or during cultural mourning practices;

- grossly unethical covid vaccine mandates which obliterated individual human rights of bodily autonomy and
informed consent, and coerced and discriminated against thousands, perhaps millions of Australian people;

- covid vaccine-induced adverse events including (but not limited to) VITT, myocarditis, pericarditis, shingles,
autoimmune conditions and many others;

- further emerging safety issues related to covid vaccines which were previously dismissed as 'misinformation'
and conspiracy including (but not limited to) specific mechanism and location of action, biodistribution, duration
of action, process 1 Vs process 2 manufacturing (of the Pfizer vaccine), DNA contamination of vials,
frameshifting due to the use of N1 -methylpseudouridine, proliferation of lgG4, and the effects of the SV40
promoter;

- the purchase of doses (i.e. why were so many more doses that necessary bought?);

- the unforgivable manipulation of the broader population regarding the origins of covid and the planned
response, and the vilification of many people simply for raising legitimate concerns, and;

- the unconscionable and continuing wilful ignorance surrounding the number, breadth, and complexity of covid
vaccine injuries (including clinical and subclinical incidence, both of which are occuring at higher rates than the
TGA currently acknowledge), the staggering level of excess mortality, and the growing number of independent
doctors, scientists, journalists, and politicians raising their concerns.

These issues listed above are of vital importance and must be addressed if we are to moved forward together,
having truly learnt from the experience of covid, and moreso from our countless mistakes in its 'management',
which arguably made any effects of the virus much, much worse.

On a personal note, the covid response affected my and my husband's life profoundly. Covid vaccine mandates
resuIted in                                                     saw my exit from my career as a registered

stripped of our rights to independent and patient-centred healthcare, informed consent, bodily autonomy, and to
work and support ourselves. As a consequence, we were forced to leave our home and relocate to another part
of the country in order to survive financially. The way we and countless others were treated was and remains
grossly unethical and inarguably wrong. As a former nurse I am horrified that our governments, health
bureaucrats, medical regulators and front line health workers have allowed such an egregious assault on ethical
medical practice to occur, one which must be rectified as soon as possible and never allowed to happen again.
While there is much evidence to support the concerns I have raised here, the time and energy required to
organise them in this response is more than I can give after the last several years of pain and suffering, on top of
a long-standing illness. Do not mistake the challenges I face in terms of personal resources for a lack of
supporting evidence, much of which is articulated by many others makin submissions to this inquiry including
(but not limited to) the brilliant                                          and

While I may not currently have the capability of compiling the academic standard of submission I would truly like,
I stand once again on the public record to defend the rights of myself, my husband, and all my fellow Australians,
to informed consent and bodily autonomy, and in support of the countless people who have been adversely
affected by one or many of the unforgivable blunders our country has made during our covid response. I implore
you and your colleagues to do your duty and diligently and impartially examine these decisions critically to
ensure this unnecessary harm will not happen again in the future.
