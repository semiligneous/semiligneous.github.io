I am an SA Health employee. Currently hundreds of SA Health employees have, or are, in the
process of being terminated due to SA Health’s vaccine policy - requirement to be vaccinated
against Covid-19 to keep their job. I maintain that being vaccinated against Covid-19 does not
prevent an individual from contracting or transmitting Covid-19 - Covid-19 is not a vaccine
preventable disease, despite SA Health changing the definition of “vaccine preventable disease”.
SA Health’s policy is discriminatory, illogical and against human rights.

My concerns about this enquiry include, but are not limited to -

•   Concerns Over Specific Pandemic Measures including vaccine procurement and secret
    contracts, mask and vaccine Mandates; lockdowns and curfews; and fear-mongering
    communication strategies deployed by public officials (e.g. official misinformation and lies in
    the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block infection and transmission, ongoing media
    censorship), silencing of doctors; the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression
    of doctors, the poor treatment of victims (vaccine injuries and deaths).

    The federal government failed to introduce anti-discrimination legislation. This allowed the
    federal government to coerce vaccination while denying it was mandated.

    The federal government need to be reminded that provisionally registered medical products
    rely on adverse event reporting to build the safety profile of the drug, and that if you then
    censor and bully people (medical practitioners, health care workers, the injured and those who
    “died suddenly”) from criticising that drug then you will break that system, killing people.

•   Concerns Over the Composition and Scope of the Inquiry including the bias of panel
    members overseeing the Inquiry and the exclusion of unilateral State and Territory
    Government decisions.
•   The Need for a Comprehensive Inquiry that encompasses ALL aspects of the government's
    response and vaccine agreements (the Federal Government have spent billions on COVID
    vaccines and treatments. Giving big pharma billions of dollars for poorly tested gene-based
    vaccines, then having                             (that pushes modified RNA and 100-day
    vaccines for the Gates Foundation) review the procurement deal might be a conflict of interest),
    regulatory failures of the Therapeutics Goods Administration, Australian Technical Advisory
    Group on Immunisation and Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.

The decision to exclude actions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments means many
key aspects of Australia’s response will go unexamined, for example -

•   Vaccine Mandates (currently still in place via work place policy’s in many States). Why
    were/are State and Federal politicians and all Federal employees exempt? Politicians amd
    Federal employees are not essential workers. Thousands of Health Care Workers have been
    terminated which has had a disastrous impact on the public health care system; ramping has
    never been worse! Coinciding with the vaccine rollout is - ramping has never been worse,
    and, excess deaths are 15-20% above the 5 year average (there should be a Royal
    Commission into excess deaths
•   Lockdowns (obliterated small business). Why was Kmart, Big W, Office Works and Bunnings
    permitted to stay open? Why were they considered as “essential services”?
•   Border closures (vaccinated people were prevented from returning to their home State. Did
    the vaccines prevent COVID or not?)
•   School closures (no clear benefits and caused social and psychological harm)
•   Mask mandates (no clear benefits and caused psychological and physiological harm,
    especially to children/young people)

The policy decisions taken by all governments - as well as the implementation of those decisions
- had significant human rights implications for people in Australia. There is undeniable evidence
available that there are parties that have manipulated public records (manipulating ABS data to
hide excess deaths), hiding evidence and outright lying to protect the stated objective and to
protect private and fiscal interests.

Australia is a federation, a democracy, and needs an inquiry that reflects this.

We need to ensure the rights and freedoms that were decimated during the pandemic are restored
and better protected into the future and we need to ensure the human cost of the pandemic, which
has been catastrophic, is properly understood so our emergency responses in the future do not
leave people or their rights behind.

Finally, I am opposed to the removal of our freedoms by State and Federal governments in the
form of vaccine mandates, mask mandates, lockdowns, and curfews, government misinformation
and disinformation (e.g. the vaccines have proven to be not “safe or effective” and that we deserve
a real COVID inquiry, A ROYAL COMMISSION, that will look into ALL aspects of how the
'pandemic' was (mis)handled.
