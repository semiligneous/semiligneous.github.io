To PM Albanese and the Covid 19 Taskforce:



Given the revelations following the New Zealand Covid data release, it is imperative that an
Australian

Royal Commission be approved as soon as possible for a proper investigation into the following :

■□corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts

■□mask mandates

■□lock downs

■□vaccine mandates

■□official misinformation

■ □lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block transmission

■ □media censorship

■ □vaccine injuries

■ □silencing of doctors

■ □the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors

■ □the poor treatment of victims.

It is now clear to everyone given the New Zealand data release, that the 'excess deaths' which many

countries (especially Australia) have experienced following the vaccinations and quite separate from
any

Covid virus deaths that this matter needs to be thoroughly and impartially investigated.

Thankyou.
