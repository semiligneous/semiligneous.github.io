I was aduring 2020 and 2021 when
the covid measures took place. I was fired in
early 2022 as I had refused to get any
vaccination after witnessing several people,
including a close family member, end up in
hospital after suffering a severe reaction.

I was fired and treated appealingly due to
government mandates which were based off
no scientific evidence. The students^^H
^^â– suffered trauma through lockdowns
only to have^^^^^^^^ltrying to
comfort them upon their return. It has since
come to light that the vaccines don't prevent
you from getting covid, nor do they stop
transmission. The government should never
have been able to manadate a vaccine.

Secondly, a whole range of other procedures
were put in place without any scientific
backing ( mask mandates, curfews, ect). The
government and health officials need to be
honest with the community and explain that it
could help. It should never be mandated
when you have no proof that it works.

Basically the government overstepped with
all there measures and handling of covid. A
full royal commission needs to take place
and apologise/compensation need to be give
 to those who suffered (the injured and
unvaccinated)
