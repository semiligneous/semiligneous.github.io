Yes. I want to share with you that the Covid-19 was a huge trauma for me.
The swimming pool was closed. The library was closed.
People walked down the street with their masks on. You could get arrested for not wearing a mask.
What is that? Australia?

It was appalling. It brought lots of division in the community and in families.

You coerced people to get the jab. no jab no work.
No freedom of choice.

People have been sick. People are dead because of the jabs not because of Covid.
