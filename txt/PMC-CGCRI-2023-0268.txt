As evidenced by the terms of reference for this enquiry, this inquiry is intended to be a
complete whitewash. I demand a proper Royal Commission with broad terms of reference
for a proper investigation into;
    •       corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts;
    •       inexcusable waiving of liability for injection manufacturers,
    •       mask mandates which have no scientific basis;
    •       lockdowns which have no scientific basis;
    • vaccine mandates and related coercion that resulted in our community being
        brutalised by police,
    •       effects to people's livelihood,
    • official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
        transmission,
    •       the disgrace of establishing the secretive and inept National Cabinet,
    •       travel restrictions that violated our freedoms,
    • profligate money printing that has resulted in high price inflation that affects
        everyone's prosperity,
    • fixation by authorities on inaccurate and misleading reporting of metrics relating to
        the event, reporting vaccine injuries;
    • media censorship of well-qualified individuals and groups espousing a narrative
        alternate to the mainstream whitewash program,
    •       silencing of doctors and the violation of the sanctity of patient-doctor relationship,
    • shutting down of schools that affected so many innocent children who are otherwise
        unaffected by the respiratory illness,
    • the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors, and the poor
        treatment of victims,
    • alarming excess deaths and the utter disgrace of our bureaucrats, institutions and
        most of our elected representatives to urgently enquire into and address excess
        deaths.

I am letting the Government know that even though this inquiry is clearly a whitewash, the
community is not happy and is demanding answers that only a Royal Commission with
broad terms of reference can deliver. The government clearly does not want a Royal
Commission because they don't have clean hands and have so much to hide. Though it's
impossible for me to prove a causal connection, both of my parents have died recently of
conditions cited by authorities as 'rare side effects' of the injections. Both my teenage
children were traumatised by the government's policies relating to C19 and how it affected
their schooling and have since dropped out of school, affecting their life-long opportunities as
well as severely impacting our family. It is inexcusable what the government and our
previously-trusted institutions have done. Culpability and harsh personal punishment needs
to be laid on the perpetrators of the tragedy of the misguided C19 policies so that witless
bureaucrats never try this again. Never violate our freedoms and destroy our prosperity
again. Never censor us again.
