      Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry Submission




It is disgraceful what the Government of this time has been involved in - both State and Federal
should be ashamed of themselves. Currently all we have heard of is sick people - and how amazing,
they are all those who have taken the experimental shots! Those who have not are all well and
healthy - and guess what the CONVID didn't kill them either. It is a disgrace the amount of money
the Government has wasted on unused vaccines - big Phama are the only winners in all this!!
