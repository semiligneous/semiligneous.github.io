Submission to the Covid-19 Response Inquiry by Maureen van der Linden
December 15th 2023


• Vaccine mandates which led to two-tiered society, ie. jabbed versus unjabbed
• Social inclusion from workplace,family, friends etc leading to ongoing mental
   health issues.
• Children kept from school for long periods leading to ongoing social concerns
   and evidence of poorer educational outcomes.
• Vaccines were insufficiently researched, leading to serious vaccine injuries,
   some potentially life-threatening and some fatal, a devastating outcome.
• Vaccine mandates still in place for some workers, eg. nurses and firemen, and
   some educational institutions, despite the now- known fact that the vaccines do
   not prevent transmission of the covid virus.
• Those needing hospitalisation re the covid virus or unrelated issues were
   subjected to sub-standard care, mental distress from isolation from close
  family, even when the patient became seriously ill, or worse,were actually dying.
• Those whose loved ones died were subject to the most distressing separations
   regarding funerals and related bereavement.
• Sealing of State borders denied family members or close family contact with
  their dying members, and even in death.
• Commerce was seriously affected not only by lockdowns but closing of these
   State borders.
• Mask mandates without evidence of effectiveness
• Social anxiety due to forced lockdowns and isolation forced on any suspected of
   carrying the virus leading to mental health issues.
• Churches forcibly closed with the threat of prohibitive fines if they remained
   open even if attendees kept the mandated space.
• Churches locked but brothels open, very strange choice here.
• Police brutality regarding quarantines, lockdowns and personal messaging.
• Those participating in peaceful protest were treated as criminals.
• Infiltrators to peaceful protest led to law- abiding citizens being “ tarred with
  the same brush”.
• Protests, such as Black Lives Matter, seemed to be given celebrity status
  whereas those democratically protesting against heavy lockdowns and
   unreasonable mandates were run down by our police, who used to be our
   protectors, and even suffered being shot with rubber bullets.

A Royal Commission must be held so that the many concerns regarding the recent
pandemic will not be repeated.


Our society is still suffering from the heavy restrictions imposed, resulting in a
society that is now more fractured and uncaring, less trusting of one another.


Our country, Australia needs to stand alone from WHO and come to a consensus
regarding future pandemics which are customised to our island continent.
