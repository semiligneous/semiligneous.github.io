I am very disappointed at the lack of breadth for this enquiry. I
was not very impacted by the restrictions imposed wholesale on
members of the community, irrespective of individual
situations. Although in a higher risk (sic) category, I was able to
adjust my work and lifestyle so as not to be particularly
inconvenienced, apart from the absurd and unscientific demand
for face masks, which as you will be aware were used time and
time again, rather than discarded after one use per mask!!!

Despite my relative lack of adverse impact, my^^^H, and in
particular my                were significantly affected, both
emotionally and educationally.

I am a volunteer at a local public school, and even to a lay
person such as me, the reading standard, especially among lower
grade students has plummeted. And how could it not be so with
the restrictions placed on their learning? As the evidence grows
from other countries, that did not impose such onerous
restrictions, less appears to be safer overall in the long run.

I hope the enquiry will come to this same conclusion and that
we never have to experience such a restriction of our human
rights again as in the years of the CO VID panic.

Yours Sincerely,
