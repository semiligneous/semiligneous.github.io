Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry



I am raising a number of issues to the enquiry that I consider requires investigation and
accountability. Its disgusting that the public was given so little time to submit to the enquiry.

1 .      The South African court released the Pfizer contract for Covid vaccines.

To view the contract go to:

https://healthjusticeinitiative.org.za/pandemic-transparency/

If Australian contracts were similar (most likely), then our Australian health officials and
lawyers who told politicians and the public that these vaccines were 'safe and effective'
were lying to you and just it made up. The contract clearly states the 'efficacy' of the vaccine
is unknown, the 'adverse events' are unknown and the 'long term effects' are unknown and
the product may not be 'fit for purpose'.

And yet, us taxpayers are still funding these^^|                       health bureaucrats
salaries and they are still pushing this false narrative despite the evidence of continuing
excess deaths and declining birth rates.

We were deceived by these people, and we expect, as our representatives, that you
immediately do something about it. Do your due diligence and do not allow an attempted
coverup.

2 . There are over 3500 published, peer reviewed papers that indicated the covid vaccines
are not safe or effective. Please see this website for a list of over 1000 published papers :

3 .The politicians made vaccination mandatory while not making it mandatory for
themselves. Now take the time to read the peer reviewed evidence of your actions. These
are the injured and dead people who elect you and pay your salaries.

of-covid-vaccine-injuries/

All Australians are waiting for an apology (at least those of us still alive).

We are also waiting for accountability for thehealth
bureaucrats and for legislation to prevent this from happening again.

4 .Now that Pfizer has admitted that it's so called vaccines were never tested for prevention
of transmissibility of Covid (that is it kept no one safe), then the ^^^^^^^Hhealth
bureaucrats and their^^^B politician, clearly just made the safe and effective narrative
up.
See:

There was NO science. It's been self-evident for at least a 2 YEARS. Your own health
department weekly statistics demonstrate that it is the vaccinated catching Covid multiple
times, going to hospitals and ICU's and dying when compared to the unvaccinated.


And yet these people continue to appear in the media pushing this faulty, dangerous
product?


Other statistics also clearly demonstrate it's the vaccinated who are sick and dead from
vaccine injuries.


Now confirmed by the product manufacturer. NO science on transmissibility.


All the mandates, coercion and bullying were and remain just a con and a punishment.


Mandates still existing in childcare and aged care are clearly ridiculous, demonstrate a lack
of intelligence on behalf of politicians and are a punishment of the people who they
regarded as 'crazy' (their words not mine).

The question is this enquiry and your ^^^^^^^^^health bureaucrats now admit the
LIES and accept accountability for the irreparable damage caused to individuals, families,
businesses and society.        being fined by courts in the billions for misrepresenting etc
have come clean. Will you?


They lied to the people who elected you to serve them. You have betrayed our trust. You
need to get on your knees and seek their forgiveness as you resign immediately from
parliament.

But before you do, you need to sack all the ^^^^^^^^^health bureaucrats who also lied
and mislead us, while taking their highly paid taxpayer funded salaries.


Surely history will correctly record the destruction you have caused. Will it also record your
apology?


S.The actual science on Face masks

Actual science shows people who wear medical facemasks get micro plastics in their lungs
and throughout their bodies via the blood.

Masks get contaminated with bacteria and fungi:

List of 40+ Studies showing Masks do not protect against Covid-19.

In fact, Masks are Harmful—filtering clean Oxygen & supporting toxic C02 inhalation which
breaks down the immune system.
