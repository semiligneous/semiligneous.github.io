            Due to the governments mishandling of the Covid 19 pandemic, I am submitting

my attached letter, ‘The Vax Mandate Killed My              to anyone that may have the courage

to bring this tragedy to the attention of all Australian citizens, politicians and in particular the

Victorian State Government.


The last time humankind was vaccinated against their will and mandated en-mass was in

1943 Nazi Germany. The governments mishandling of the C19 pandemic included having

no-one and no-where online or phone, to state this case or submit to. The Vaccine Claims

Scheme does not allow for death caused by vaccine because the first thing that accompanies

your claim has to be a statement from the jab issuing doctor that they were wrong and made a

mistake.


As if they will do that not knowing what's in it and having been granted total indemnity by

the Vic. government.


There is no provision for me to be acknowledged or heard because of the litigation that would

follow should my ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^juthbe an admission of fault by the government,

the doctor, the vaccine. As one legal professional put it to me, “Getting the government and

the doc to literally accept responsibility and blame for your^^^^eath would be an absolute

miracle”. Even though it is the truth.


Those that didn't lose their beloved during the pandemic, have already forgotten about

Covidl9 and the murderous mandate.




                            The Vax Mandate Killed My
At the height of the Covid 19 pandemic about May/ June 2021,                        my

            was advised by her employer to get vaccinated (no jab, no job) She went to get her

AstraZeneca jab as a part of the Victorian government’s vaccine mandate. I told her to make

sure and tell the doctor of her medical history o                issues including the time she

was hospitalised wit               an<                                 which she said she did. I

told her to make sure she got either an exemption or Pfizer as the AstraZeneca dose was

linked to                 and^^^H


She came home after seeing the doctor                                   and said she didn’t feel

well. She then told me she was administered the AstraZeneca vaccine as there were no

exemptions and because of her agi         it would have to be AstraZeneca. I asked her if she

told the doctor about her history, and she said yes but he assured her that it was safe. She

never fully recovered from this first jab. Myself and family members noticed her waning

condition and her laboured movement, she tested negative to covid. She had to sleep in a

sitting up position to be comfortable. In September she had a covid test which proved again,

negative.


The no jab no job policy came about, and the Victorian government required everyone to be

double vaccinated^^^^^]work place called her and told her to get her next jab as they

may soon be required to return to the office.^^^^Bmade the appointment as she worked for

kids from dysfunctional families and the courts. It was a particular and important area that

relied on her expertise, she wasn’t going to let the kids down. I begged her not to go to the

same doctor or get the same shot (AstraZeneca) as she was still sick from the first dose. I told

her to quit work, I said I would go with her, but despite my efforts she went and had the

second jab at the same place with the same^^Hdoctor who said she would be fine.
                                               was rushed to hospital^^^^^vhere she had

another         She was placed on a             for the next 3 days (NOT COVID RELATED).


She began to recover for approx, six days, able to speak bui

      . As I was making arrangements to bring her to the                where I work, I was told

to come in as she had a^^^^^^|in her^^^^^H                                                I then

watched my




In conclusion, it is my belief that the vaccine mandate, the rule of no exemption and an

doctor have caused m               death. AstraZeneca within a low blood plate count that

signifies causality are hard to find in arterial area’s like the brainstem. According to several

doctors these are found mainly in veins not arteries. The death summary highlights all of the

condition^^^^H had, ticking every box for a reaction to AstraZeneca. We were told her

              was normal, AstraZeneca not responsible. The death summary clearly shows

her               was at times very low and at other times very high. I was told later that the

doctor who did the death summary made mistakes. No doctor would sign anything.


In the process of submitting a record of circumstances that led to            death to the

government, I had to fill in 3 forms namely an MO062, MO063 and an MO064. The MO063

(doctors form) is laughable as it requires a doctors signature admitting blame and

AstraZeneca responsibile fo             death. No doctor or person would sign a document

condemning themselves. Promising anonimity, i asked several doctors (hypothetically, and

unaware of the outcome) what would they do i               and her past med history presented to

them. None of them would have administered AstraZeneca...None! As it was already

condemned in many countries throughout the world.
As two doctors said to me. “The timeline is too close to be unrelated”.adding that " it would

be harder to prove that it wasn't the cause".


Sincerely
