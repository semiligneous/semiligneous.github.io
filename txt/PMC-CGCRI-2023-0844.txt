I am respectfully requesting a full Royal Commission for a proper investigation into:

         Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts
      2       . Vaccine mandates
      3       . Vaccine injuries
      A. Mask mandates and lockdowns
      5 Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block infection and
         transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gaslighting of the injured
      3 The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable harm of the vaccine
         and their action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical Profession.

Who decided to do the opposite of the 2019 Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic
Influenza, which prophetically described why al! of the actions the Government did take would network
and would cause hardship?


I personally lost my employment of 7 years because of vaccination mandates by Clubs NSW. Which
have since been repealed because the vaccinations were deemed no longer necessary. I suffered loss
