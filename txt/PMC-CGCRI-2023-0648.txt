COVID INQUIRY SUBMISSION




My submission is very short:

Why did the Government throw out the Pandemic Plan that had been developed and instead went
with the^^H plan.


Why did Morrison form a "National Cabinet" for a State by State approach rather than take a national
approach.

Why were citizens locked in their homes, shot with rubber bullets, arrested violently, fined for
ridiculous things like sitting outside, etc?

Why were deaths reported as covid when many of the dead had serious morbidities before covid
came along.
