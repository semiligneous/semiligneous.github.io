You people are responsible for me losing my job and subsequent financial stress for myself and my
wife from loss of income. I suffer from a type of          which is managed by medication and I
could not get any straight answers from going to my GP's, they would not comment on how the
covid injection would affect my condition and they would not give me an exemption even though
they would not guarantee my ongoing safety as far as adverse effects with my             I was bullied
and threatened by my employer, who was not interested in my medical condition and they
subsequently dismissed me from my job. I have found it very difficult to find employment since. My
wife took the first injection and had a heart reaction from it and has ongoing pain and other issues
since. She was stood down from her job and this whole fiasco has cost usoyer^^^^Jn lost
income and savings. We have also had 3 people we know develop rapid ^^^|after being injected
by the poison.

I know that this whole process is a joke as you people only want to be seen to do something but will
do nothing in the long run.

The ^^^^HPoliticians, Business and Public Servants that foisted this on the Australian people need
to be charged with crimes against humanity and sentenced
