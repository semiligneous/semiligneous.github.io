Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry

I prefer to maintain anonymity with reference to my submission. I have a very simple question for the
Australian Government and that is, what data and information did the Australian Government have
in their possession to deem the alleged "vaccinations" safe and effective?

I would like to know how an experimental product that is regulated by the Office of Gene Technology
can be considered a vaccine that is safe and effective?

I obtained a letter from my doctor saying that I had presented for the vaccine which was required by
my employer to remain employed, however due to not receiving the information I had requested by
my employer I did not have sufficient data or evidence to make an "informed decision" regarding the
vaccine and my doctor was unable to provide the vaccine because it went against the informed
consent requirements in the Australian Immunisation Handbook. Despite this, I still lost my job. Who
is liable for this?

The entire financial trail of the pandemic needs to be thoroughly investigated as there was massive
consequences for all Australians and society world wide.

Thankyou.
