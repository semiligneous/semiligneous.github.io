I thank the Committee for the opportunity to make this submission.


The PFA made a more detailed submission to the 2020 Inquiry into the Australian Government's
response to the COVID-19 pandemic where we raised a range of issues that impacted on police
throughout and post the pandemic.

Policing is predominantly the responsibility of state and territory governments and our roles during
the pandemic do not fit neatly into this Inquiry's Terms of Reference, however, there were
numerous issues and strategies, agreed through National Cabinet, that police were responsible for
enforcing, that became problematic as the pandemic unfolded.

In our 2020 submission we highlighted a range of matters, particularly in relation to police
occupational health and safety issues, including -


    •       Access to and the quality of personal protective equipment (PRE) and its priority
            procurement;
    •           Priority COVID testing of 1st responders;
    •       Ensuring presumptive workers compensation legislation where an officer contracts COVID,
            ensuring that it's accepted, it was contracted in the course of their duty;
    •       The importance of legislation for offences of spitting or deliberately coughing on police and
            other 1st responders;
    •       The lack of workplace amenities at remote check points such as toilets, showers, protection
            from weather, provision of meals and facilities for sleeping;
    •           Challenges with social distancing requirements in police watchhouses and in courts;
    •           Policing in remote and indigenous communities; and
    •           The impact of working during COVID on the mental health of officers.


The pandemic also impacted police in a range of other instances, including -


        •          The impact on community attitudes towards police during a range of high profile incidents;
        •          The impact on police resources;
        •          Access to childcare during periods of lockdown when officers were required to work;
        • Access to public transport or car parking during periods of lockdown when officers were
             required to work; and
        •          Police involvement in the quarantining of returning travelers.


Whilst I would be happy to provide material on any, or all, of the points raised above to the Inquiry,
due to space limits and in consideration of your Inquiry's Terms of Reference, I will limit this
submission to issues around police "access to and the quality of personal protective equipment and
its priority procurement".


From the commencement of COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns, access to appropriate PPE
became an issue of concern for police. Whilst it is accepted that in normal circumstances it would be
the responsibility of the employer, in our case, the respective police forces, to provide such
equipment, no provision appears to have been made for a national response to such a crisis.


Issues identified by members that could have been averted by a national response to the provisions
and procurement of PPE include -


    •       In general, initial sourcing and funding of PPE was the responsibility of local police
            commands, leading to shortages of equipment and an inability to quickly source
            replacement supplies. This was of specific concern, particularly in smaller commands and in
            smaller jurisdictions;
    •       Members being told to use the PPE sparingly in the early stages of the pandemic to keep it in
            reserve for when things got worse;

    •    Low stocks of face masks, as the pandemic came close on the back of the bushfires, as well
         as gloves. This concern was amplified when many police were deployed to various locations
         taking responsibility for quarantined travelers and when conducting close community
         interactions such as random breath testing operations, compliance checks for people who
         were required to self-isolate or when auditing travelers' movements at numerous
         checkpoints;
    •    The suitability of the equipment, having regard to the nature of the work and any hazard
         associated with the work;
    •         A suitable size, fit and reasonable comfort for the wearer; and
    •         The equipment not having been maintained, clean and hygienic or in good working order.


Disasters such as the 2019-20 bushfires and now the COVID-19 outbreak amplifies a greater
emphasis on a new federalism in policing. State and territory borders remain but are being
enhanced by greater national strategies and national collaboration. These national initiatives, being
driven by a national coalition of governments and public safety agencies, is vitally important when
tackling disasters that cross state borders.


However, in policing, in many instances, when it comes to equipment, each jurisdiction, still -


     •        Draws up its own standards and product specifications;
     •        Individually trials the same or similar products;
     •        Separately determines potential suppliers;
     •        Separately writes contracts for products;
     •        Individually undertakes tender evaluations; and finally
     •        Purchases products.


Now is the time to ensure a greater collaboration in the procurement of appropriate PPE and other
relevant equipment, across not only police jurisdictions, but possibly across other 1st responder and
health agencies. A greater collaborative approach to purchasing such commonly used equipment
should be central to the Australian Government's drive to improve productivity, enhance national
standards and performance and make monetary savings where feasible. Any such outcome will
likewise improve future frontline services to the community.


I would be happy to provide any further material to expand on any aspects of this submission.


Sincerely yours,




Scott Weber APM
Chief Executive Officer
