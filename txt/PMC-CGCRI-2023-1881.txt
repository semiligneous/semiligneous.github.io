Hi,

My name is           a Senior citizen.

I fled communist China to call Australia home because we have freedoms here.

I urge the government to make a proper inquiry into the Covid response.
In my opinion it was a massive overreach.

Coercion is not consent.

Medical experiment must not be forced on citizens.

Many have lost their livelihood as a result. Many have suffered serious side effects.

Please do the right thing immediately.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,
