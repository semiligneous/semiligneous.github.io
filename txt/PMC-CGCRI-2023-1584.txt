To whom it may concern
  This is my submission on how the government's response negatively impacted my life. I
have stage 1 Autism, OCD and panic disorder. I was unable to access ally support systems
during the shutdown and due to the mask mandate, I had worsened symptoms due to
breathing and touch sensitivity issues.
I had a number of exchanges with my doctor, who I once trusted, due to him trying to coerce
me in to get vaccinated. Which I was not comfortable with due to the lack of supporting
evidence and having to sign a waiver saying they were not responsible for any negative
impact of the vaccine.
