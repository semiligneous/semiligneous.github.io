                                        RE: COVID-19 Inquiry

 Women in Super has prepared this submission in response to the call for submissions and evidence
 to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry.


 WOMEN IN SUPER
 Women in Super (WIS) is a national advocacy and networking group for women employed in the
 superannuation and wider financial services industries. WIS advocates to improve women's
 retirement outcomes and access to superannuation.


 OVERVIEW
 In 2020, the previous government allowed Australians experiencing financial hardship through the
 COVID-19 pandemic to access up to $20,000 of their super. 5 million applications for up to $10,000
 payments were approved. Data has shown that in only 14% of cases was this money used exclusively
 for household expenses, rent or mortgage payments, or paying off debt1.

 Allowing Australians to plunder their super for purposes other than retirement has
 disproportionately impacted women and low-income earners, and for some, their balances will
 never recover.

 Of the 2.9 million Australians who accessed their super early - the lowest income earners will be hit
 hardest. The bottom 20 per cent of wage earners will lose $3000 a year in retirement and have little
 or no change in their age pension entitlement because they will already be on the full rate2.

 It is estimated up to 1 million Australians wiped out their entire super savings. Industry Super
 Australia estimates a 30-year-old who took out $20,000 would be $80,000 worse off at retirement3.

 A joint analysis conducted by Women in Super and AIST in 2020 found that the gender gap in
 superannuation doubles for women under 34 if they have used the early release of superannuation
 scheme to combat financial hardship brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Women aged 25 to 34 withdrew on average 35% of their balance, compared to 29% for men in the
 same age bracket. In all age brackets, women withdrew a greater proportion of their account
 balance when compared to men. Between ages 30 to 34 the median account balance for women is
 $30,129. Withdrawing $10,000 is 1/3 of the balance of the member's account, and withdrawing a
 second amount would leave the member with around $10,000 in their account4. This was seen in

 practice in the funds, who saw members aged 18-24 withdrawing an average of 78% of their
 balance, and members 25-39 withdrawing 68%5.



 RECOMMENDATIONS

 Australian women were let down by this scheme, which was not analysed thoroughly on the long­
 term impacts and their disproportionate effect on women and low-income earners.


  We strongly recommend:
       •   A gender lens is applied to all future policy changes to ensure women do not continue
           to be unfairly impacted and future generations are not relegated to a retirement in
           poverty.



 Yours faithfully,




 Jo Kowalczyk,
 CEO, Women in Super
