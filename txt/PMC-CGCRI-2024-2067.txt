I am an Australian seeing the negative impacts of both the federal and state
governments management of the covid pandemic and Covid Vaccine
mandate have in my communities.

This includes:
• Mental health issues caused by the lock down.
• Suicide caused by the lock down.
• Elderly and regular Australian being treated badly / unjustly by police acting
like thugs and using excessive force.
• ^^^^^Hbehaviour by state leaders such as Daniel Andrew, Mark
McGowan, Anastasia Palaszczuk and Michael Gunner.
• Financial issues caused by people who were not able to work because of
the lock down and / or vaccine mandate.
• Family breakdown, students are not allowed to go to school, workers
terminated because of the vaccine mandate.                       _____
* Immediate and long term health issues resulting from the jab            GBS,
        | myocarditis to name a few).
• Death caused by the Covid vaccine.

Just a small sampling of studies below are proofs that the mask, the lock
down and the vaccine mandates are unjustified, even resulting in detrimental
result to human’s well-being.

• Mask study shows ‘little to no difference’ in preventing COVID, Flu infection.

I call on a proper investigation into:
• Corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts.
• Mask mandates.
• Lock downs.
• Vaccine mandates.
• Official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines
to block transmission.
• Unjust and cruel behaviour by the police towards people who speak up
against the lock downs and mandates.
• Vaccine injuries.
• Media censorship, silencing of doctors who speak differently or offered
different solutions and ideas.
• The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors.
• The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in suppressing effective medication such as
ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine so the government can push the vaccine
mandate.
• The poor treatment of victims.

There needs to be a proper covid inquiry similar to the royal commission to
learn from the mistakes of the past so that this is not repeated. Through this
dark and sad period, many of us Australian have been stripped off our human
rights in not being consulted or given the freedom and coerced to bow to the
premiers on whatever they felt was necessary to “keep us safe” which turned
out to be untrue as elaborated above.

Hence, I truly hope that there will be genuine efforts to do better given the
coronavirus will be here to stay (just as flu continues to stay) but I believe that
better measures to boost our natural immunity would be more helpful rather
than draconian and authoritarian measures as demonstrated in 2020, 2021
and 2022. It would be great if Australia will just try to be humble and have the
courage to learn what Sweden did compared to all the other countries. They
have turned out to have less casualties from this pandemic though initially the
laughing stock for refusing to do all the ridiculous things other countries did
which turned out to be far more detrimental.
