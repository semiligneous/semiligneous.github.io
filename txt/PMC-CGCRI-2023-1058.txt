Dear Sir, Madam

With regard to the “Covid Enquiry” I request a full Royal Commission for a
proper investigation into:

   1.      Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts
   2.      Vaccine mandates
   3.      Vaccine injuries
   4.      Mask mandates and lockdowns
   5. Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of
       vaccines to block infection and transmission along with denial of vaccine
       injuries and gaslighting of the injured
   6. The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable
       harm of the vaccine and their action along with ATAGI to silence the
       Medical Profession.
   7. Who or what was responsible for waiving the 2019 Australian Health
       Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza.
   8. Behaviour of State and Federal police forces 2020 to date and drivers of
       that behaviour
   9. Behaviour incl. rulings of the various levels of the Australian judiciary
       2020 to date and drivers of that behaviour
   10. Relationship incl. financing flows between local, State and Federal
       governments on the one hand and print, TV, Internet and radio media on
       the other.
   11.      Relationship between CEPI (chair:              and any and all actions
       taken in Australia in regard of “Covid^OzlHo date.
   12. Relationship between Wellcome Trust, UK (chair of non-executive
       directors: Julia Gillard) and any and all actions taken in Australia in
       regard of “Covid” 2020 to date
   13. Relationship between staffers of TGA and the WHO: which staffers and
       what is the nature of the relationship?
