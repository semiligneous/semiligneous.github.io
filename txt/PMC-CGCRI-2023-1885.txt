Background

I scrutinise Regulators.

From 2008 to ~2011 I paid FSANZ hundreds of dollars of my private money to access the Regulatory
Submissions of the GM crop inventors - Monsanto, Bayer, Syngenta, Dow, DuPont and BASF.

It seemed to me that only two people in the whole of Australia scrutinised this data - I was one of
them. I suspect I was frequently the only person in Australia doing this. I wrote hundreds of letters
to MPs and Senators to tell them about the messes of genetic inventions, about corporate fraud, and
about our malfeasant Health regulators.

Eventually I teamed with a virologist and an environmental scientist, put it all down on paper and we
published it in the Journal of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews. It is a paper cited as
often by genetic engineers as it is by precautionary scientists.

GM crops were frequently designed to make "just one protein", but they were messes of many
proteins, broken code and innumerable transcripts. Every genetic invention is a mess, and this has
been documented. Regulation was co-ordinated and global, and FSANZ never rejected a GM crop
application.

It is beyond belief that another Australian Health Regulator, the TGA, without any Guidelines to
assess the safety of the Adenoviral and modMRNA inventions, approved the direct injection of the
genetic messes, to the most extraordinary harms.

This COVID-19 Response Inquiry

I understand this is a sham Inquiry, incapable of scrutinising all the Federal and State players and
their decisions in the COVID-19 Response. We need a Royal Commission.

I am using my private money again to purchase data to show the lives lost to these genetic messes,
that should never have been approved, and certainly not mandated.
