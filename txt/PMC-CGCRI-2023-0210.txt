To whom it may concern,

Thank you for taking submissions from people impacted by the government’s COVID-19 response.

My family and I were impacted by being made to wear a mask in public, which made it more
difficult for us to breathe. The scientific journal Nature has in July 2022 published researched
showing that virus particles are too small to be blocked by masks, so masks do not keep out
unwanted particles. However, masks do provide an excellent breeding ground for bacteria and
fungi, both benign and pathogenic. Direct link to this research here:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15409-x If you are ever tempted to require mask
wearing again, please realise that this is detrimental to everyone’s health and is of no use against
viruses, and instead encourage people to avoid wearing masks.

Since the doctors were discouraged from giving vaccine exemptions, my husband who has had
heart arrhythmias had to choose between an experimental CO VID-19 vaccine with a track record of
causing chest pain, heart palpitations, and other heart problems, or quitting his job. Please, in the
future, do not allow businesses to force employees to choose between experimental drugs and their
work.

Every person was impacted in one way or another by the government’s response to COVID-19.
Please launch a Royal Commission to determine how to handle any future pandemics in a healthier
manner.

Regards,
