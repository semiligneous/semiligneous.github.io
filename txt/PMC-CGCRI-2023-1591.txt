•   My spouse and I never caught Covid-19 even though both of us did not take any C19 vaccines
    and we had travelled overseas earlier this year. Both of us are in our 70s.
•   The Covid-19 vaccines do not stop infections nor transmissions, why were they mandated?
•   There were no long-term studies available prior to the mandates so even experts do not
    know the extent of the adverse effects that they might cause. How could they be mandated?
•   Adverse effects caused by the Covid-19 vaccines suffered by people we personally know
    include myocarditis and pericarditis.
•   We do not need young people to take Covid-19 vaccines to protect us while they take on
    unknown risks themselves.
