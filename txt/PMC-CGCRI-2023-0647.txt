Consequences of Government COVID Measures on Unvaccinated Individuals

Dear Anthony Albanese,

I am writing to share the profound impact that the government's COVID-19
measures have had on me as an unvaccinated individual.

   1. Alienation from Society: The government's measures left me feeling
      alienated from society. I found myself marginalized and stigmatized due to
      the divisive discourse surrounding vaccination status. The societal shift made
      me feel like a pariah, rather than a regular member of the community.

   2. Prevention of Basic Activities: Daily life became a challenge as the
      restrictions prevented me from engaging in basic activities like grocery
      shopping and accessing my local fitness center for my regular swim. These
      limitations not only affected my physical health but also disrupted the routine
      that I once took for granted.


   3. Ineffectiveness of Face Coverings: The mandate to wear face coverings,
      which the CDC later admitted to being ineffective, raised questions about the
      necessity of such measures. The realization that these mandates might not
      have provided the intended protection only added to the frustration of
      adhering to them.


   4. Isolation from Social Venues and Friends: Government restrictions deprived
      me of the ability to participate in social venues and gather with friends. This
      isolation contributed to feelings of loneliness and detachment, significantly
      impacting my mental well-being.


   5. Travel Restrictions: The limitations on travel further constrained my life,
      limiting my ability to visit the nearest beach or other recreational areas due to
      my vaccination choice.


   6. Public Perception and Stigma: The compliance-oriented public discourse
      turned many against me, fostering an environment of judgment and
      discrimination. This shift in public perception strained relationships and
      created a hostile atmosphere that persisted throughout the past year.


   7. Personal Tragedy: Regrettably, the toll extended beyond the social realm.
      The death of my uncle from suicide during this period added a profound layer
      of grief and sorrow, highlighting the collateral damage associated with the
      challenging circumstances.
   8. Strain on Personal Relationships: The immense strain on my personal
      relationship became increasingly challenging. The external pressures, coupled
      with the societal discord, tested the resilience of my closest connections,
      adding another layer of complexity to an already challenging situation.


   9. Stress, Divisiveness, and Unhealthy Living: The cumulative effect of these
      measures made my life incredibly stressful, divisive, and unhealthy. The
      constant anxiety and societal strain had pervasive effects on both my physical
      and mental well-being.

I would like to underscore that the previous year, I was a regular, contributing
member of society. However, a single decision not to vaccinate subjected me to a
drastic shift in how I was perceived and treated. I urge the government to thoroughly
investigate the consequences of the Covid-19 Pandemic response.

Sincerely,
