The Covid Pandemic and the way that it was enforced left me without work because I would
not be vaccinated. I was ostracised from my community because of my decision to not be
coerced into getting the jab. The deep divide caused by fear, misinformation portrayed in
the media left me without any support or ground to stand on. The border control left me
without family to return to. I was not welcome in my own home, in my work, in my
relationship or in public spaces. I was extremely anxious and isolated. I struggled to make
ends meet and had a deep uneasiness with all the uncertainty and judgment around me.
I believe in freedom of choice, especially when it comes down to my own body. I am
healthy, young and have no desire to give my health away because it is enforced upon me. I
am still healthy young and have never had covid. I am angry and afraid that the governing
forces which I expect to help protect and value us as human beings were instead oppressive
and fear mongering. I expect the governing bodies of this country to respect our freedom of
choice and not bully us into submission. I will not submit.
Going forward:
It is important to listen and respect individual people's choices even if you don't agree.
It is important to allow all people equal rights to work and public places and services.
It is important that our medicines are proven to be effective and never to be enforced upon
people.
It is important to trust that our leaders are there for us not against us and that truth will
always prevail and our government will be held accountable.
