As an employee of the                            having given ample warning to my employer that I did not want to
have the risky mRNA type vaccine but was happy to have conventional covid vaccine (eg Novovax), I was
basically informed that it was mandatory and a condition of employment ie effectively blackmailed to be vaxed
against my will which I understand is contrary to the Aust Immunisation Authorityâ€™s own charter. This is
reprehensible. Worse still a fellow staff member, having acquired myocarditis likely from the vaccine had
specialist cardiac advice against a further booster but even they were told to have the vaccine or employment will
be terminated. This mindset was prevalent throughout the department and there needs policies in place to
prevent this total loss of perspective and callous disregard for their employees health ever happening again.
Whatever the cost to the public purse, vaccination or for that matter any medical intervention should never be
forced upon employees or the public against their stated will. Dress it up how you like but this was blackmail and
totally unacceptable, indeed totally un Australian.
