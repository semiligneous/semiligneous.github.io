To whom it concerns,

I am writing to share the profound impact that the government's COVID-19 measures have had on me as
an unvaccinated individual as well as society, as a whole. I am now counselling people who have
experienced great trauma and stress (PTSD) from the mandates, lockdowns and the other extreme
measures made since March 2020.

Alienation from Society and work:
The government's measures left me feeling alienated from society. I found myself marginalized and
stigmatized due to the divisive discourse surrounding vaccination status. The societal shift made me feel
like a pariah, rather than a regular member of the community. I lost 2 jobs after mandates came in. My
income was effected.
Prevention of Basic Activities:
Dailv life became a challenge as the restrictions prevented me from engaging in basic activities like grocery
shopping and accessing my local fitness center for my regular swim. These limitations not only affected my
physical health but also disrupted the routine that
I once took for granted.
Ineffectiveness of face Coverings:
The mandate to wear face coverings, which the CDC later admitted to being ineffective, raised questions
about the necessity of such measures. The realization that these mandates might not have provided the
intended protection only added to the frustration of adhering to them.
Isolation from Social Venues and Friends:
Government restrictions deprived me of the ability to participate in social venues and gather with friends.
This isolation contributed to feelings of loneliness and detachment, significantly impacting my mental well­
being.
Travel Restrictions:
The limitations on travel further constrained my life, limiting my ability to visit the nearest beach or other
recreational areas due to my vaccination choice.
Public Perception and Stigma:
The compliance-oriented public discourse turned many against me, fostering an environment of judgment
and discrimination. This shift in public perception strained relationships and created a hostile atmosphere
that persisted throughout the past few years
Personal Tragedy:
Regrettably, the toll extended beyond the social realm. I knew of people in my community who had died or
become very ill due to the covid vaccines. During this period added a profound layer of grief and sorrow,
highlighting the collateral damage associated with the challenging circumstances.
Strain on Personal Relationships:
The immense strain on my personal relationship became increasingly challenging. The external pressures,
coupled with the societal discord, tested the resilience of my closest connections, adding another layer of
complexity to an already challenging situation.
Stress, Divisiveness, and Unhealthy Living:
The cumulative effect of these measures made my life incredibly stressful, divisive and unhealthy. The
constant anxiety and societal strain had pervasive effects on both my physical and mental well-being. I
would like to underscore that the previous year. I was a regular, contributing member of society. However,
a single decision not to vaccinate subjected me to a drastic shift in how I was perceived and treated. I urge
the government to thoroughly investigate theconsequences or the Covid-19 Pandemic response.

       I would like to elobrate on the violation of human rights which restricted people from working and
       doing normal every day things, like going to restaurants, public spaces, sporting events, music
       events, etc unless they had received 2 covid-19 vaccines without real evidence that this would
       really help the transmission of what was considered a serious pandemic virus. There was no
     research on all the full extent of the dangers and adverse reactions that these vaccines could have
     on everyone in the community. No one could make a fully informed decision with the censorship of
     differing medical opinions and reports from around the world. For example, I watched a video on
     facebook which gave an account of a doctor from Canada reporting about the record number of
     still born births that were occurring among covid-19 vaccinated pregnant women. This you tube
     was taken down in days, same with countless other videos with health and medical professionals
     like a whole round table discussion with one person who was heavily censored Dr Robert Malone
     (inventor of MRNA vaccines). My proof is that you can't find the you-tubes that were once public. I
     have searched but if I look back to my facebook messages there is no longer even a link you can
     follow.
I lost 2 jobs during the mandates. Even with all the evidence I used and my own medical reasons, that
weren't taken into consideration. I will attach one of the letters which included much data from the
TGA and other government sources + human right laws like the Nuremberg code. Some of the issues I
presented are below:


    •   The vaccine companies’ trial and study documentation and the surveillance data from
        overseas reveals numerous adverse health events linked to the vaccines including
        hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, anxiety related reactions, increased triggers for
        autoimmune disease, thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders, exacerbation of
        neurological events, paralysis, convulsions and death.
    •   The biggest risk with both vaccines is auto-immune response. From an immunology
        perspective, the antibodies may be ‘tricked’ into destroying otherwise healthy cells
        when encountered in future.
    •   Previous coronavirus vaccines have never passed the pre-clinical stage. SARS-
        CoV vaccines were tested in a number of animal trials conducted which resulted in
        consistent auto-immune reaction outcomes. Furthermore, the m-RNA vaccines have
        not been used on humans before.
    •   The disease COVID-19 presents a 99.9% rate of full recovery for those under 70 years
        of age with no serious co-morbidity. Directing and/or mandating vaccines on the whole
        population given these statistics is a disproportionate response.
    •   It remains unclear if any or sufficient insurance cover will be available in the event I
        suffer injury, and in the absence of a comprehensive no fault vaccine injury
        compensation scheme, there is a real likelihood that I may not be compensated.
    •   The vaccine companies have a history of criminal conduct including charges and
        convictions for illegal marketing, bribery and health care fraud.
    •   The Australian Government has made it abundantly clear that vaccination against
        COVID-19 will be voluntary for the Australian public and no disincentives will apply (e.g.
        denial of financial benefits) to those choosing not to get vaccinated.
    •   Alternative controls are available to employers and occupiers to maintain occupational
        health and safety and public safety.
    •   Approvals were given without complete safety and efficacy data being available. The
        long-term safety and efficacy of these vaccines are unknown.
    •           The duration and effect of vaccine protection from these vaccines are unknown.
    •           Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic infection and viral transmission is unknown.
    •           The concomitant use of these vaccines with other drugs and vaccines is unknown.
    •           Vaccine data in pregnant women and lactating mothers is unknown.
    •           Vaccine efficacy and safety in immunocompromised individuals is unknown.
    •           Vaccine efficacy and safety in paediatric subjects (< 16 years old) is unknown.
    •           Vaccine efficacy and safety in elderly subjects (> 85 years old) is unknown.
    •   A correlate of protection has yet to be established. The vaccine immunogenicity cannot
        be considered and used as the surrogate for vaccine protective efficacy at this stage.
    •           The novelty of the mRNA technology and its possible effects are unknown.
        •   The real-world vaccine effectiveness when these vaccines are rolled out to a larger and
            more diverse population is largely unknown.
            Other issues I will mention below.
        •   Forcing many school students to use screens intensively, there were issues with school age
            children getting on to Porn sites such excessive use of screens with a big screen addiction
            contributing to large amounts of mental and social problems . I learned about this with a
            discussion I had with^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Hin November this year.
            Not enough acknowleagemen^n^^ove^^f mental health issues that occurred because of
            the extremely long isolating lockdowns in Victoria. I have spoken to a counsellor who said there
            was a cover up of how many suicides occurred and are still occurring due to the stress and
            trauma due to lockdowns, forced vacccinations, etc.
        • Extensive health issues occurring from the vaccines. I know several people who have had
            vaccine related injuries and friends who have had deaths occur in their families. My mother had
            a reaction to the vaccine on the day of some of her jabs.
There is currently a whistle blower in NZ who has done the right thing revealing the true nature of the
excess deaths occurring from the CO VID -19 Vaccine in NewZealand: https://rumble.com/v3yp4eg-m.o.a.r-
expos-is-out-now.html This statistician,              L 56, has been arrested by New Zealand authorities for
exposing this data:__________________




The underlying mortality rate in New Zealand should be only 0.75%,               . So the odds of all these
deaths haonening bv chance is aonroximatelv 100 billion to 1.




Hopefully one day in Australia we too will have a deeper understanding from having access to more detailed
and sophisticated data which will reveal more clearly in Australia the adverse reactions and deaths that have
occurred here from the Covid-19 Vaccines. Many doctors have been silenced and are now speaking out. I
have spoken to some nurses and doctors who have spoken the truth about the effects of the vaccine and the
things that happened in the hospitals over the last few years.

I demand a full Royal Commission into:
1. Vaccine procurement & secret vaccine contracts
2. Vaccine mandates
3. Vaccine injuries
4. Mask mandates & lockdowns
5. Gov misinformation in the media
6. The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety & their action with ATAGI to silence Drs
Who decided to do the opposite of the 2019 Au Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza, which
prophetically described why all of the actions the Gov did take would not work?
