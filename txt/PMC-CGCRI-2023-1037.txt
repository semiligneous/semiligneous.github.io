Submission to Covid Enquiry.




76 year old Veteran

I strongly object to Prime Minister Albanese reneging on his promise of a Royal Commission into the
Federal and State Governments management of Covid 19 and substituting this WATTERED DOWN
enquiry that will not look at many areas that should be investigated.

I wish to express my disgust at the terms of reference which clearly seek to limit the scope of the
enquiry.

Federal Governments continual insistence that there "WAS NO Vaccine mandate" as well as allowing
the States to run ruff shod over the citizens rights was disgusting.

I respectfully submit that any enquiry that doesn't address the following list is a whitewash

States over reaction in regards lockdowns

States closure of borders

States obvious callus disregard for normal people's emergency travel requirements while facilitating
Film stars and Sporting teams.

States in appropriate use of Police Force resource's against their own citizens.

Federal and State should be investigated to see if they miss used available science and gagged
comment from competent dissenting voices.

Federal and State gagging of Doctors and all levels of the Medical system.

The sacking of thousands of employees who didn't want the experimental vax - while boldly
maintain "THERE IS NO MANDATE"

The failure to reinstate those employees.

The UNBELIEVABLE indemnity given to the manufactures of the experimental treatment.

The Financial arrangements made with the Vax manufacturers.
