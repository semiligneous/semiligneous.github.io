Request for Royal Commission



It has been brought to my attention that the Covid Inquiry from the Office of
Prime Minister and Cabinet is requesting submissions by December 15. In
response I request a proper Royal Commission for a proper investigation
into; corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts; mask mandates;
lock downs; vaccine mandates, official misinformation and lies in the media
regarding the ability of vaccines to block transmission, vaccine injuries;
media censorship, silencing of doctors, the role of AHPRAand ATAGI in
censorship and oppression of doctors, and the poor treatment of victims.
The community is not happy and is demanding answers that only a Royal
Commission can deliver.
