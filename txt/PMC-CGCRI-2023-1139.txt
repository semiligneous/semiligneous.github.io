SUBMISSION COVID-19 Response Inquiry




The only thing that I would like to say is that there was never a need to shut Australia down, never a
need to shut people out of their jobs, and never a need to demand everyone take an untested-in-
the-long-term still-on-trial injection that has proven to be a killer.

Should any further "pandemic" (highly questionable term) be orchestrated, please leave us alone to
live our lives and allow us to protect our lives and health as WE see fit.

The overreach by government was sickening and astounding, and the fact that unelected bureaucrats
made decisions on our behalf was disgusting. We do not need the UN, the WHO, the WEF, or any
other body telling us what to do.

The fact the media parroted endlessly misinformation about the 'virus' and the 'jab' was far and
away once of the most disturbing situations of mind control and fearmongering that we have ever
experienced. Never ever let this happen again.

Thank you.
