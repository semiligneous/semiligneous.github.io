Many issues related to the handling of the Covid response need to be examined fully and
accountability must be ensured for all of those responsible for the ensuing breakdown in the rule of
law and the widespread violation of human rights .

In particular:

1) The lack of transparency by the 'National Cabinet' and by health bureaucrats. Any taxpayer
   funded contracts must be fully accessible to the public unless national security is at risk, which is
   not the case here. All health advice should be fully transparent and open for debate.

2) The lack of debate in all areas of Covid management, especially in the areas of early treatment and
mask wearing.

3) The suppression/censorship of any dissenting views in relation to possible treatments and/or
concerns about the safety of the experimental gene therapy injections.

4) The Federal Government consenting to State Border closures as well as State mandates for an
experimental gene therapy which contravenes the Nuremberg Code.

5) The banning of known cheap, effective, safe treatments such as Hydroxychloroquine and
Ivermectin.

6) AHPRA's treatment of doctors who questioned the safety of the experimental mRNA gene
therapies or who gave exemptions based on their individual patient's medical history or lack of
informed consent.

7) The unwillingness to examine the excess mortality being seen in Australia since the rollout of the
experimental gene therapies (which is also being seen in all heavily injected countries around the
world).

8) The purchase of SO many vials of mRNA gene therapy at such a cost to the taxpayers, placing the
country into serious debt levels.

As a taxpaying citizen of Australia I expect that this inquiry will thoroughly investigate the handling of
all aspects of the Covid years and ensure that all government ministers and bureaucrats involved are
held accountable for their decisions/actions to ensure human rights abuses never occur in this
democratic country again.
