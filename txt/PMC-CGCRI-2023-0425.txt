To whom it may concern,

I am deeply concerned about the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts in
Australia, fearing a lack of impartiality in the ongoing inquiry. The potential misuse of privilege by
those responsible for any mishandling demands urgent attention.

groups.

and interstate travel limitations.

Australians lost security, including bodily autonomy, through forced vaccination and other restrictive
measures.

Cruel Treatment (Article 5):

Harsh actions by authorities during protests and mandatory vaccination for some professions may be
perceived as cruel.

Discrimination (Article 7):

Government collaboration with social media platforms to silence dissenting voices, eroding freedom
of expression.

Freedom of Assembly (Article 20):

Political Participation (Article 21):

The political system has ignored the will of the people, necessitating a higher body to address the
crisis of trust.

Social Security (Article 22):

harm.

Australians deserve a fair, impartial, and independent investigation to restore trust and protect the
rights and freedoms of the entire population.
