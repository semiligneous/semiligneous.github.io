            Submission to the Covid-19 Response Inquiry

               To the Members of the Independent Panel


I am writing this submission to voice concerns over certain aspects of Australia's response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. While I recognize the importance of the Inquiry's goal to improve
pandemic preparedness, there are critical areas that require thorough scrutiny.

             Concerns Over Specific Pandemic Measures

                         Masks and Vaccine mandates
The implementation of mask and vaccine mandates had significant impacts on individual
freedoms and social dynamics. These measures, often invasive, warrant a detailed review to
assess their necessity, effectiveness, and proportionality.

                             Lockdowns and Curfews
The economic, social, and psychological impacts of lockdowns and curfews have been
profound. An evaluation of these measures is essential to understand their long-term effects
on the Australian society and whether they were the most appropriate response.

                          Communications Strategies
It is quite clear that there was an unwarranted use of fear in public health messaging. Its
important to analyze whether such communication strategies were effective or whether
they contributed to unnecessary panic and distress among the public.

   Concerns Over the Composition and Scope of the Inquiry

Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have
previously expressed support for certain pandemic measures raises questions about the
objectivity and impartiality of the Inquiry Panel members who have expressed support for
such measures should recuse themselves.

    Exclusions of Unilateral State and Territory Government
                                        Decisions
One of the most significant omissions in the Inquiry's scope is the exclusion of actions taken
unilaterally by the state and territory governments. These decisions, including state-imposed
lockdowns and border controls, were pivotal to the nations pandemic response and should
be included in the inquiry.

                 The Need for a Comprehensive Review
While the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry are extensive, it is crucial that the above­
mentioned areas are not overlooked. A truly comprehensive review should encompass all­
aspects of the government's response, including those currently outside the Inquiry's scope.

                                      Conclusion
This submission represents a collective call for a more inclusive and thorough investigation
into Australia's COVID-19 response. It also urges for freedom and liberty to not ever be cast
aside with fearmongering as it was by Australian governments during the pandemic. We
urge the inquiry to consider these points to ensure transparency, accountability, and the
safeguarding of Australian values and liberties.
