Submission to the COVID-19 Response
Inquiry - Michael Skopal

My submission to the inquiry is based on my experience as a business person and private citizen. During the
Covid "emergency" ! was required to navigate the maze of different rules and regulations made by federal and
state bureaucrats as well as local councils.

The local council responses were more humorous and inconsequential as well as demonstrating their
irrelevance to our lives outside of roads, rates, and rubbish.

I returned in March 2020 from a 6 month stay                         a mandatory 2 week self-isolation period
at home (in           As I was unwell anyway, lived on my own, was able to work from home and had friends
and family able to support me with shopping and general support, I managed the logistics of my isolation.

It was in the latter period of my 2 week self isolation period that my GP instructed me to seek a covid test as I
was still unwell. This was to be my first brush with the health bureaucracy that was to dominate our lives for
next two years. At                                had my first covid test and on completion I was told by a junior
staff member that I had to isolate for a further two weeks. I explained that I had already nearly completed my
two weeks required for returning overseas the individual insisted that the period had to restart because of the
test, which was negative!

I made a phone inquiry but could receive no clarification on the matter of further isolation from the
bureaucracy so I chose to ignore the instruction.

This was my first brush with what was to become, in my opinion, an era of health bureaucrats "drunk" with their
own power, easily handed to them by our elected officials.

During the next two years my work and family commitments took me interstate, primarily to
and              Fortunately I was not required to travel to^^^M

Nevertheless, the constant rule changes for travellers in            made even those trips unpredictable
with extended stays required             and^^^H The latter was in the^^^Jcaravan park in a tent with
daytime temperatures approaching 40Â°C during the period.

At one point I travelled with my partner to             vr          and th             track. When we reached
^^^^^Hshe departed to return to                 At that point there was a small outbreak of Covid in     I so all
travellers returning from anywhere in                including            had to isolate in              Ifor 2
weeks.

This mandate was totally out of proportion with the risk and a complete over reaction by the
authorities. I did write to my local member                    in protest.

Later I found my self having to go to|      by road from a property in centra
where I have been working for a few weeks. This trip resulted in my only being able to return to            if I was
prepared to quarantine for two weeks.

Again a complete over reaction by the                   authorities.         was functioning well and business
in the city and state ran as normal yet a return home was hindered. I ended up stating for 5 months before
driving back via
Finally, the ultimate embarrassment as aresident came towards the end of the "covid era"
when friends visited me fromOn arrival they had to download an app to their phones and report their
well being to the app.

It was a complex app as well as being overly intrusive into their lives.

These are only some of my recollections from the Covid period.

As a private citizen I felt the response between states was uncoordinated, self serving for the individual
bureaucrats combined with a total disregard for personal responsibility of the country's citizens.

Confusing rules about self isolation combined with different definitions of "close contact" all lead me to believe
that the rights and privileges of citizens were ignored.

I also felt very disappointed by our elected officials who failed to balance the requirements of business and
personal needs of their citizens with the overzealous demands of the health bureaucracy.

I hope in future state and federal parliaments conduct themselves much better and in a far more balanced
manner to allow us to make our own decisions on travel, attendance at church or other social gatherings.
