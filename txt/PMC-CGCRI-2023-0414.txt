Due to Federal and State Government directives followed by the
School my employment contract was nullified when mandates were introduced in
December of 2021. The                                 failed to honour the signed contract
when the mandates were lifted. I have not been able to find employment in schools since
being mandated and have been on JobSeeker payments for 2 years. I have^^^^H

formally adopted by his                                       employer. He was forced to
go into early retirement and is withdrawing money from his Superannuation Fund for our
living expenses.

The vaccine did not stop infection or transmission of Covid 19. Therefore the mandates
were criminally wrong.

We have experienced abuse from medicall^qnorent coworkers and family, exacerbated
by Government Chief Health Officewho publicly encouraged
discrimination and distributed incorrect Heath advice. The risk/benefit analysis of mass
vaccination was never conducted and never proven to be beneficial to any age group or
demographic except the immune compromised. Encouraging children to take the
vaccination to “save their Grandparents” was a criminal act.

The education sector and all other mandated employment sectors are now experiencing
catastrophic employee shortages due to mandated workers still being excluded and
because of the vaccine injured or vaccine fatalities in the remaining workforce.

This was a public health disaster and should never be perpetrated on the Australian
People again.

Hi |

I hope you are doing well. Please see letter below that was sent to staff.

Dear Colleagues,

At our school we value loving kindness. Over the next few weeks, we will all need to show understanding and
compassion as we navigate what will be tricky waters for us all.

The directive that was announced on Tuesday will require us to act in certain ways as a school. Please know that
everything we do will be with the school’s best interests at heart within the context of the direction we have been given,
and in full discussion with everyone involved.

Please be assured that the Leadership team is working with the support of the Board, ^^Hand H

The following is information that has been directed by ^^^^o be given to all employees.


As you are aware, the Commissioner of Police, acting in his role as the State Coordinator responding to the COVID-19
pandemic, has announced the Emergency Management (Education and Early Childhood Settings Vaccination) (COVID-
19) Direction 2021.

This Direction requires all employees to receive at least 1 dose of a Therapeutic Goods Association approved COVID-
19 vaccination and a booking to receive a second dose by 10 December 2021, except those who have a medical
exemption endorsed by the Chief Public Health Officer.

The Direction applies to all staff engaged by the school on a permanent, fixed or casual basis. Importantly, the advice
we have is that all staff must comply with the Direction to continue their employment at the school.

Therefore, to assist our school to comply with this Direction, we will require all staff to provide evidence of their
vaccination status by Friday 26 November.

Please email your COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate, or medical exemption, to |

and only accessible for the purposes of preventing and managing COVID-19 in our school community.

If you have not yet received your first dose, are unable to comply with the Direction or you are concerned about
vaccinations, please speak to me as a matter of urgency so that we can discuss your ability to carry out the requirements
of your role after 10 December 2021.

Kind regards
