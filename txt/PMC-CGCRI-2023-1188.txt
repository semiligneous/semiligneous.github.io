Dear Sir/Madam



I was greatly affected by the Federal and State Government mishandled actions. I had
                      |job which was removed from me, by the mandatory nature and coercion to
vaccinate with the unknown AND untested substance, a substance that only had very short trials and
was                                                             The evidence of excess deaths in the
freely public date,'Oi   Wc Ic   i Data'are reconfirming the actions I took to lookout for my own
health were very much justified.



The Government or my previous employer have no right to force medical procedures on its people.
Let me be very clear as this is so important - I'm opposed to the removal of our freedoms by
governments in the form of mask mandates, vaccine mandates, lockdowns, and curfews. They
should never do this again.



We all deserve a real COVID inquiry that will look into all aspects of how the 'pandemic' was handled,
as the cost to me looking out for my health was extreme. I've suffered ^^^^^^funcertainty and
lost hope and trust in governments and employers. I was only terminated to save the company
money on redundancy, as many more have been let go.



Please bring a FULL COVID inquiry - address everything that happened please.



Regards
