INTRODUCTION

My family is one of about 500,000 Australian households affected by severe

My partner has                 disease and severe               conditions, which are managed with
                     medications.

He was unable to work for most of        due to the risk of contracting COVID in the workplace,
and has recently switched to a newTn^nwork that is mostly outdoors and much lower risk.

Our family spent most of 2020-21 at home, with^^^^^f remote teaching our^^young children
while I worked from home.

KEY HEALTH RESPONSE MEASURES

Our initial experience of the pandemic was positive, as we felt well supported to work and study from
home, and received financial support from the government.

But we became increasingly concerned throughout 2021 when it became apparent that the vaccine
roll-out was not working as intended. The priority system collapsed and my partner was not able to
receive his first vaccine until well after he was originally supposed to.

Australia's opening-up plan was also largely predicated on vaccines being able to control
transmission of the Delta variant and Paxlovid protecting high-risk people (1). The public was assured
by government that if a new immune-evasive variant emerged, we could manage it by tweaking our
pandemic controls.

However when Omicron arrived, Paxlovid was still many months away. Unfortunately Australia did not
change course and the country went into election mode, minimising public conversation about the
pandemic and opting for a politically expedient approach.

The country adopted a vaccine-only strategy with little consideration of long-term systemic and
structural changes, especially in regards to airborne transmission. Existing sick leave provisions were
inadequate and the country was and is facing stalling booster rates among elderly and low child
vaccination rates, plus a looming long COVID burden.

We also observed little government engagement with high-risk communities and
                       individuals. Targeted public health messaging was close to nil, and we had to
search ATAGI technical documents to find the relevant information, which often changed arbitrarily
overnight, often unknown to our doctors. Several^^^^^^amilies and their specialists in our circles
were unaware children were eligible for booster doses months after ATAGI approved them because
no one from government shared that information with them.

When schools and workplaces reopened in late 2021, my family sought accommodations to continue
learning and working from home untilwas able to receive the full course of primary
vaccines for^^^^^^^^^^^^people and antivirals became available. However, there was
almost no support, consultation or communication from government and authorities at this time about
the ongoing risk to severely^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H. Essentially, we were at the whim of the
educators and employers, most of whom were poorly equipped to be making clinical decisions on our
behalf.

Financial support from government was prematurely withdrawn, leaving my family living below the
poverty line. Work and school accommodations were refused for many vulnerable people, and we
received no guidance on how to assess individual risk, often waiting months for expensive annual
specialist appointments.

Antivirals only became very belatedly available to desperate families such as ours. Three days before
the 2022 federal election, Professor^^^^^^^Brevealed in a primary care update that only 1000 or
so Australians had received the antiviral medication Paxlovid through their GP (2). That meant up to a
million doses, each worth more than $1000 and with a short shelf-life of nine months, were stockpiled
in warehouses while people died (3).

Clinically vulnerable people were not prioritised for PCR during the Omicron surge and rapid tests
were difficult and expensive to source. Pleas for help from patient groups were all but ignored (4).

Treatment pathways were opaque, and^^^^^^^^^^^Hpeople never received free or
subsidised P2/N95s or rapid tests like other vulnerable groups. Proper P2/N95s were prohibitively
expensive and only available to the public at large mark-ups with long waiting lists. Even if you had
the financial means to buy them, most P2/N95s were strictly rationed to healthcare workers for most
of the pandemic - it was illegal                          people to buy them.

                     people were very belatedly permitted access to antibody testing in Australia,
and monoclonal antibodies were often rendered ineffective by the time they were finally approved for
use. Many severely                      people remain ineligible for antivirals due to
contraindications.

Even by March 2022, a significant proportion of NDIS participants had not received their second
vaccination, having been deprioritised for vaccination in 2021 (5, 6, 7). Some disabled people were
among the last to be vaccinated, when they were meant to be at the front of the queue.

The federal government at that time did not quantify disabled deaths, with the Federal Minister for
Social Services telling parliament in February 2022 they were not collecting the relevant data (8).

Plans to form a National Schools Plan with federal air purification/ventilation standards and hybrid
learning systems collapsed, as did attempts to streamline antiviral and PCR access via methods used
overseas such as “Test to Treat” (USA) or back-pocket scripts (New Zealand).

Now, in 2023, hospitals are winding back PPE protections in clinical environments, in direct opposition
to the wishes of high-risk patients and Australia's National COVID-19 Health Management Plan for
2023, which purportedly prioritises “those at risk of severe illness, including through targeted
supports” (9).

The shift to “personal responsibility” ignored social, political and commercial determinants of health,
and governments fell into the trap of “ecological fallacy”, drawing conclusions about high-risk
individuals based on group data. As Dr Cecilia Tomori says, ‘“Personal responsibility' rhetoric allows
corporations and governments to absolve themselves of the responsibility they actually hold for the
health of the public. And importantly it allows for locating moral blame at the individual level.” (10)

MECHANISMS TO BETTER TARGET FUTURE RESPONSES

In future, pandemic responses should include specialised consultation and communication with
^^^^^^^^^^^|people. This should be systemic and structural, and be streamlined using up-to-
date technology.

As the July 8, 2022 AHPPC statement says: “The AHPPC reiterates the shared responsibility of
individuals, employers and governments in minimising the impact of COVID-19.” The document
outlines a number of steps that communities, business and government should take in regards to
vaccination, treatment, testing, hygiene, ventilation, sick leave, masking, business continuity and
OHS.

A National Schools Plan is crucial for identifying the different risk profiles of school families. A national
hybrid schooling system will help children from high-risk families to learn remotely from home, while
national ventilation and air filtration standards will minimise learning disruptions and help
accommodate high-risk families in face-to-face settings.

The COVID-19 consensus paper published in Nature journal on 03/11/22 also summarises essential
steps governments should take to control an ongoing public health threat such as COVID (11, 12).
Another useful resource is Advocacy for Inclusion's white paper and Shared Statement, which
includes suggestions such as a COVID Inclusion Guarantee, which allows high-risk people to access
essential services in a COVID-safe way (13).

Workplace regulators should also promote better understanding among employers (including
hospitals) of their legal obligations under OHS laws and disability anti-discrimination legislation (14).

Most importantly, Australia needs an organising framework for community consultation and response
to represent and communicate the needs of high-risk and marginalised communities most affected by
the pandemic, namely elderly, immunocompromised and disabled patients.

These state or federal peak bodies should not be filled with clinicians or academics. They should be
community-based and patient-led.

The organisations could be modelled on the AFAO and NAPWHA, which emerged in response to
HIV. Similarly, a national COVID-19 commission could be modelled on NACAIDS, which operated in
the 1980s-90s.

My first submission outlined my family's personal circumstances with                         and how
we have been affected by the pandemic.

I would like to make a short, second submission underlining the importance of maintaining inclusive
healthcare and accessible essential spaces and protecting vulnerable Australians.

Australia's National COVID-19 Health Management Plan for 2023 purportedly aims to protect “those
at risk of severe illness, including through targeted supports”.

Yet all over the country, hospitals and clinics are winding back PPE protections or ignoring air quality,
often with the excuse that patients will acquire COVID in the community anyway.

Many places are not even tracking nosocomial infections (2).

This overlooks the fact that our most vulnerable may take precautions in the community but often
cannot protect themselves while unwell in hospital or seeking care, resulting in a much higher death
rate among hospital-acquired cases (3, 4).

I personally caught COVID while attending a                                  public hospital ED while
seeking treatment                                      While I tried my best to wear an N95, I was forced
to remove it to drink water and take pills. I was surrounded by obviously symptomatic patients and
staff, in a poorly designed ward with no natural ventilation and no apparent air filtration. A COVID­
dedicated ward had recently shut due to lack of staff. After being sent home, I was later taken back to
hospital via ambulance due to COVID symptoms. It has taken me many months to recover at the cost
of my personal health and finances.

This story is being repeated all over the country. Vulnerable people are being harmed and dying
because Australia does not have a good grasp of the “network topology” of transmission (5).

Academic and HIV researcherprovided an excellent analysis of this concept in an
article called, ‘Lock down smarter, not harder', which outlines the heterogeneity of networks and
social groups, and the importance of investing in the capacity of affected communities to respond to
outbreaks.

To truly protect our most vulnerable, we need to redouble our efforts to reduce transmission in
hospitals, especially EDs, high-risk wards, and aged care settings.

Stalling booster rates in aged care are of particular concern. At last count only 39 per cent of aged
care residents were up to date with boosters (6). Anecdotally I have heard this is because many aged
care facilities are pooling their booster sessions, and require a minimum of 20 residents to offer on­
site boosters.

These systemic failures are largely a result of our poor understanding of the network epidemiology of
COVID.

Conversely, we must truly understand who and how COVID is mostly likely to harm if we want to
protect our most vulnerable Australians.
