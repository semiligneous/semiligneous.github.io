Covid 19 Response Inquiry

I wish to submit my views to support a full inquiry into the Covid 19 response.

    1.   Vaccine contracts should have been disclosed to the public including evidence of trial results
         by any participating pharmacy companies. ^^Jwas forced by the court of law to reveal
         information - this should be automatic. Any politician with any interests in any vaccination or
         association with same should be made public eg        I believe has a relative
         who was involved in contact tracing.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1 was adviser to
    2.   Evidence was produced by many specialists in the field of vaccinations from around the
         world that the vaccinations were causing harm - World council for health sent a letter with
         evidence and information to many leaders globally including ou^ovemmenUnei^i^^^^
          Australia to CEASE TO VACCINATE. Other specialist such as Dr
         ^^^^|and many others raised concerns and yet they were silenced or ignored. Evidence
         based on science and specialists should be presented and debated. So, while we were
         mandated, locked down, masked up the politicians here were except from covid vaccinations
         Each state premier could dictate, make their own rules and decide what was acceptable for
         the community- no basis for their decisions as health advisors were not considering any
         global evidence that it was causing harm.
    3.   APHRA ran their agenda on silencing those practitioners that did not agree on the
         vaccination for their patience. Doctors take an oath to protect their patients and have a duty
         of care to provide the best outcome -they have the history the experience and knowledge to
         assist their patients in deciding to vaccinate or not. APHRA should not be given the power to
         override the decision making of a medical practitioner.
   4.    Blocking of information which the government regards as incorrect should be investigated
         especially if the source comes from those specializing in the field of vaccination. Australia
         should not be part of the WHO or should sign any treaty with same. We are a democratic
         country and the WHO giving advice through Covid was incorrect and they changed their
         protocol many times. We need to exit the WHO completely.
    5.   Vaccine protocol takes 6-10 years to produce yet this was rushed through without evidence
         of safety or efficiency and the results of the excess deaths and the adverse effects the covid
         19 vaccination had is being seen today.                   _______________
    6.   Alternatives to the covid vaccination were available and Dr                       saved many
         lives using ivermectin. TGA stopped the use of ivermectin which had been on the market for
         45 years - The government should investigate other measures that can assist is preventing
         covid or assist in recovery. I had a script for my^^^^^^^^^^Myet I was not allowed to
         fill the script- The TGA put a stop to anyone with a script for Ivermectin and medical
         practitioners were prevented from advocating same.
    7.   We need a full inquiry into all aspects of the covid 19 vaccinations. It destroyed families, it
         has created harm and adverse effects and it has contributed to our excess deaths as
         evidence has shown by many qualified here and overseas. Our TGA APHRA should be part of
         the investigation as well as the premiers prime minister at the time and any other authority
         who advocated false information and imposed rules on the community that were not
         justified.
