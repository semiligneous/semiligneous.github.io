Covid 19 enquiry.



In the entire year of 2020, not a single soul in our circle knew anyone afflicted by Covid-19. There
wasn't even a whisper of someone who knew someone who had heard of someone with the virus.
When the powers that be declared a pandemic, the masses were left clueless, grappling with the
inexplicable chaos that ensued. The media, operating in a relentless hysteria for three long years,
terrorized the population. Hospitals became no-go zones, thanks to a protocol mandating the use of
Remdesivir, a notorious experimental drug with a deadly reputation.

Trust in the media has plummeted to rock bottom; scepticism now shrouds every news report.
People have awakened to the harsh reality that all levels of government, regardless of political
affiliation, betray the public trust and cannot be relied upon.

Any rational individual scoffs at the government's lockdowns, restaurant closures, border
shutdowns, business closures, travel restrictions, mask mandates, and church closures. Adding insult
to injury, those in power exempted themselves from the vaccine mandates, further fueling public
outrage. Families have been torn apart by government-imposed divisions, with most succumbing to
the pressure and getting vaccinated, while the dissenting few are treated as pariahs.

The adverse effects of the vaccines are apparent within my own family—my wife enduring a near­
death experience after her second shot, and my daughter grappling with ■■■■■■■■■■■I
       Even my brother, initially resistant, succumbed to coercion, only to meet an untimely demise
mere months later. The impact extends to my grandchildren, with two unseen due to the
tumultuous circumstances.

Schools, once pillars of education, now act as enforcers of medical decisions. My youngest grandson
was coerced into vaccination; his entry into school was contingent on compliance. Legal action
looms on the horizon, targeting the school, government entities at all levels, and medical
professionals involved, invoking the Nuremberg Code that demands the death penalty for those
administering experimental drugs through coercion.

The fabric of our society has unravelled beyond recognition. Regardless of affiliation, political parties
dance to the WHO and WEF tunes, rendering them indistinguishable—the police force, once
protector of the people, has morphed into a tool of oppression. We now see them as
rather than guardians of public safety.

Any hope for a genuine inquiry into these atrocities is quashed by the very government responsible
for this crime. The prospect of justice seems bleak, as the investigation is tainted by the criminal
hands that orchestrated this nightmare. The very essence of life in our country has been irreversibly
altered, leaving us grappling with a dystopian reality crafted by those who were supposed to
safeguard our well-being.
