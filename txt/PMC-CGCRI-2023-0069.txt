My name              I was a Theatre Technician working)

I worked through COVID Pandemic in^^^^|prior to the mandate. We intubated patients requiring to
be placed on respirators over night in Theatre. This was before fit testing was a requirement and
available. I have a very small face and we only had large N 95 masks that were not air tight on my face.
Even though Covid -19 highly contagious and I was exposed to the sickest patients, I still to this day have
not have a case of COVID-19. I saw patients wheeled into theatre prior to the infection control overhaul
with garbage bags on their heads to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The garbage bag was open at the
shoulders and the patients exhaling was not contained. It was senseless, pointless and sad to see.

I was stood down before mandate due to working night shift. I started my shift before midnight. I was
assured I would be paid as normal, but that didn't happen. I left the state for work. I've had a lot of
career changes since I was lawfully dismissed because I'd rather wait until the clinical trial vaccine had
more results. Pfizer formula has been changed since it's release. In            the law does say you need to
pay people to participate in a clinical trial and not to coerce them into it to keep their job.

I moved tofor work after some time in^^H I've worked in a
                                                                                          was as satisfying
or rewarding as my role as a Theatre Technician.

I decided to be vaccinated in^^^^^^^^^o return to work in^^^^^H. I can't return to my role as
a Theatre Technician until next year after the minimum more than 6 months required between vaccines
has passed. I received the Nova Vaccine                  I intend to receive the booster in March when
I am legally allowed.

I was unaware of the progress of the mandate policy in hospitals in^^^^Hwhile I was out of state. I
was interviewed for a position in hospital when I returned                 thinking that I was fully
vaccinated. I received and offer and it was rescinded due to the policy of 3x vaccine prior to on boarding.
I am not fully vaccinated until I am boosted.

At this time feel the 3x vaccine mandate is as senseless as the garbage bags on patients heads that were
open around the shoulder still leaking infections air.

Please revise the current policy for newly vaccinated people. I understand that people who are only just
receiving their first and second dose should not exist in ^^^^^Hunless they are under 18, but people
do change their minds for the love of their careers.

I remember when the vaccine was being given in primary schools and now it's not advised for under
18's. Revisions can be made. Please make an acception for the revision of this policy made in 2022.
Hospitals get accreditation from the government. That's ultimately where the decisions are coming from.

Kind regards,
