To whom it may concern

I am a research student in             and I have a range of health concerns that mean I need to
avoid Covid infection.

The devastation of “let it rip”

Ever since “let it rip” has come to prevail in Australia, the consequences have been devastating.
Those of us who seek to avoid infection by SARS CoV2 find ourselves cut out of many aspects
of public life.

One-way mask-wearing, putting all the onus on the individual and doing almost nothing at policy
level is unacceptable.

Vaccine procurement

I am dismayed that ATAGI has not recommended children under 5 be vaccinated as they are in
many other countries. This is unacceptable.

Australia risks sliding towards an anti-vax mentality, given the low emphasis given in this
country to fighting SARS CoV2 by vaccination and by boostering.

Furthermore, the government’s vaccine procurement policy has been woeful: late, slow,
faltering, and leaving us unprotected in the face of major waves, including the current
November/December 2023 wave.

The silence and poor messaging of public health

Overall, my key dissatisfaction with how the Pandemic has been handled relates to the period
when controls were relaxed, and the virus was encouraged to spread. I feel that public health
messaging in this phase of the pandemic has been weak and lacking.

Public Health authorities need to strongly counter the false message that “Covid is just a cold”.

I want to see strong public health campaigns advocating masking as a simple and practical step
that people can and should take in crowded environments. I want to see messaging that
explains respirators are better protection than surgical masks. I want to see public health
strongly encourage people to get boosted.

Thank you for your time.
