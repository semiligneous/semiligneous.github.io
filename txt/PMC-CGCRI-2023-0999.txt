To: Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

With regard to the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

This letter is with regard to a call for submissions for the Covid Inquiry from the Office
of Prime Minister and Cabinet

I request a proper Royal Commission for a proper investigation into;
   •     corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts
   •     mask mandates
   •     lock downs
   •     vaccine mandates
   •     official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to
       block transmission
   •     vaccine injuries
   •     media censorship
   •     silencing of doctors
   •     the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors

and the poor treatment of victims.

The community feel this is a whitewash and are not happy.

We want answers that only a Royal Commission can deliver.

Sincerely,
