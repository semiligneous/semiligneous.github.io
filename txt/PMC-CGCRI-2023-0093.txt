Executive summary

The past 4 years (2020-2023) stand as a salutary background against which future trust in public
health should be considered. In 2020 most governments around the world subscribed to the story of
an existential health crisis and a one size fits all final defence solution for the masses in the form of
patented, novel inoculation drugs. One group of drugs was based on mRNA and the other on
adenovirus technology.

Australia's initial isolationism during the early COVID scare provided the opportunity later to obtain
an insight not available to most other nations. The key to achieving this insight is the published ABS
mortality metadata for points in time prior to 2020, through the period prior to the commencement
of inoculant rollouts, to the period after the commencement of rollouts, and beyond. When the ABS
data is examined using techniques of identification by exclusion, it shows unintended shortening of
life by a "cause unknown". Metadata from global COVID, Australian COVID and the Australian
inoculation program lends itself to posing some reasonable hypotheses relating to excess deaths.
For those hypotheses to be further substantiated they must be tested against unadulterated micro­
data. This submission urges the Commonwealth of Australia COVID-19 Inquiry (the Inquiry hereon)
to secure and release the raw microdata of mortality for analysis from January 2020 until the
present time.

Facts

    1.   Significant excess deaths appeared in the ABS records as soon as use of the novel inoculants
         began in early 2021.
    2.   COVID attributed deaths were immaterial to excess deaths until (6 months later) in July
         2021.
    3.   5,125 excess deaths were experienced prior to significant COVID death attribution began.
    4.   Ongoing excess deaths against pre-pandemic baselines continue to be reported by the ABS.
    5.   Excess unexplained deaths for the 30months since the start of the vaccine rollout have now
         exceeded 40,000 people.
    6.   The WA Government has published evidence of a large increase in reported vaccine injury
         since the start of the COVID vaccine roll out.
    7.   The British Medical Journal quotes research indicating that no more than 10% of serious
         vaccine injuries are officially reported when reporting is left to the dead and injured.
    8.       Infection with the virus confers superior immunity to COVID than the novel inoculants.
    9.       No novel COVID inoculants have moved beyond provisional approval by the TGA.

Observations

    1.   Based on the WA injury data (and research, noted above in point 7, indicating
         underreporting) it can be extrapolated that between 1 and 5m Australians experienced
         COVID inoculation injury.
    2.   Many of those experiencing inoculation injury will be the vulnerable with compromised
         immune systems. It is possible that some vulnerable (and healthy) people when faced with
         the shock of the inoculant, died.
    3.   Some excess deaths were caused by COVID however many COVID attributed deaths were
         from co-morbidities other than COVID.
    4.   2023 COVID Inquiries in England and Scotland have heard that older patients testing positive
         for COVID were in many cases "written off" and treated with "end-of-life" programs or
         "euthanasia-type" interventions (or had lifesaving interventions withheld) that contributed
         to their demise. This response increased the number of COVID attributed deaths.



                                                                                               Page 3 of 51
                                                               231215 - PFParadice COVID Kruk lnquiry 2023




    5.   Statistics indicate that many people with death attributed to COVID did not have their lives
         shortened.
    6.   Excess deaths in the meta-data are temporally correlated to novel "vaccine" use. The
         relationship between "cause unknown" and "COVID vaccines" should be analysed, and
         causation ruled out.
    7.   Marketing imperatives may have driven the "COVID vaccine" narrative and thus the possible
         overuse of high-risk drugs with possible catastrophic injuries and death for some people for
         whom the knowable benefit-cost ratio was negative (particularly for those who had acquired
         natural immunity through viral infection). A novel technology was pushed that was a radical
         departure from the technologies people thought they knew and understood and was then
         promoted under false pretences to cohorts of the population who stood to gain little or no
         benefit from the technology.

Loss of trust

During the COVID panic and in the period of heavy coercion (at the release of the novel COVID
inoculants), young people were told they would be responsible for killing their grandparents if they
did not have the inoculation. It became a "pandemic of the unvaccinated". Australians were also told
that natural infection did not confer immunity and that inoculation was the only mechanism to avoid
hospitalisation and almost certain death.

It now transpires that the novel drugs neither stopped transmission or infection in the inoculated
cohort. It is also established that natural infection confers better immunity than the manmade
inoculants. Australians now know that this claim and other important claims were misinformation
from their health authorities. Tellingly, against the orthodox narrative of the day, as a general
principle, vaccines are deployed as a protection for the individual receiving the drug - not for the
protection of others. In addition to these revelations Australians are becoming aware that the
ongoing excess death rate is more highly correlated with the use of the novel drugs than the virus.

The consequence of advice from authorities turning out to be misinformation is likely to become
manifest in active distrust of the Australian health authorities and the profession.

Private manufacturers striving for business success (profitability) and protected by government
indemnity are more able to take risks with human lives than businesses liable for product failure
affecting human health. An awareness that provisionally approved products are indemnified by the
user themselves (taxpayer) may cause scepticism (loss of trust) in the products.

Restoring trust

The restoration of lost trust in Australian health authorities is an important challenge to be resolved.

As matters stand, there is a significant danger that if a real national health emergency arose the level
of trust in Government is so low that reasonable people might actively resist and thwart genuinely
sensible health measures. This not an ideal situation for Australia. The author knows of people (pro-
vaxxers pre-2021) who refuse to take a vaccine of any sort as long as the current incongruous COVID
narrative remains unaddressed.

Several initiatives will be required to address the trust issue. Implementing a full cost recovery user
pays system for the people choosing to use the novel COVID drugs will be helpful to testing the
commitment of Australians to these provisionally approved drug interventions.




                                                                                               Page 4 of 51

Discussing and taking action to stop the excess deaths will be crucial to restoration of trust.

Removal of indemnity protection for "COVID vaccine" manufacturers will be "but a small step" in a
long stairway to Australian Government redemption and restoration of trust. Perhaps it is better for
democracy and more appropriate that Australians remain highly vigilant and more sceptical of
government and public health leadership than in the past. The format of the 2023 Albanese COVID
Inquiry will certainly assist in sustaining low levels of trust.

A further suggested action that could be deployed to build trust would be to place all information
submitted to the Kruk Inquiry before an international panel of eminent persons (chaired by a
respected Australian) for review. This parallel international panel of review could be commissioned
to deliver a report addressing the same elements as the Kruk Inquiry with the trust that comes with
"no past connection" to the management of the Australian COVID event.

Appropriate people to sit on such an international panel of review could include:

                                  (past Deputy PM of Australia) Chair
                                  ^^^^■(USA)
                           (UK)

                                  (Belgium)

The partial remedy

The long road to restoring trust includes reassurance that in the case of vaccine injury proper
avenues of redress are available. An absolute and unqualified blanket ban on Commonwealth-
backed indemnities is totally justified and will help with that process.

The material in the body of this advisory submission demonstrates some of the authors research,
and perceptions regarding the extent of the hurt Australians have experienced from the Australian
government's (State and Federal) responses and management of the COVID-19 event.

This material should assist in managing expectations regarding public health and provide some
insights into, and resources for, the restoration of trust in a manner that is nuanced, responsible and
sensitive.

1     Background

This advisory submission to the Commonwealth of Australia COVID-19 Response Inquiry (Inquiry
hereon) has been prepared and presented by Peter Paradice of

This submission includes an analysis and interpretation of ABS mortality metadata and provides details
of personal experience and research to gain an understanding of the issues that lie behind the data as
they relate to the response of Australian governments during the COVID-19 event. This paper is the
authors personal work and is founded only on the official Government numbers. It does not rely on
the data, interpretation, or information of others.

The sources from which data and comments have been acquired for inclusion in this SUBMISSION
include the following:

            •   Australian Bureau of Statistics
            •   Australian Federal Dept of Health
            •   Personal experience

Things have changed since January 2020. Many people have lost all trust in the integrity of
Government, the medical establishment, the pharmaceutical industry, and the medical profession.
While still living in a democracy, individuals are able, to express these sentiments without fear. This
process is democracy at work.

The so called "vaccines" for COVID referred to throughout this advisory are the mRNA and
adenovirus vector inoculants purported to improve immunity and health outcomes (over all other
options) against the now benign COVID-virus.

The data examined in the past SOmonths contests the underlying premise, continually propagated
by government, in respect of these novel "vaccines", that:

        ............ COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.

In respect of the novel COVID inoculants, the ongoing confidence of Australian authorities in this
underlying premise is remarkable. With so much that seems unknown (and with data withheld) in
current assessments of the untested (over time) mRNA and adenovirus vector drugs, it seems
logically less risky at this juncture for Government to suspend the use of the novel inoculants.

Unlike the Swiss, it seems unlikely that the Australian Government has the integrity, fortitude or will
to suspend the novel COVID inoculation drugs. This being the case the acid test to ensure the drugs
are truly safe and beneficial is for manufacturers (currently hiding behind the taxpayer warranty) to
be made liable for compensation if the products are proven to cause injury or death.

The charts in Attachment 1 indicate that the project is effectively over. The proponents of ongoing
inoculation have lost the argument (using the wall of silence technique) against the Australian
people.

2          Government responsibility

2.1 Inoculant ("vaccine") safety indicators

COVID news in recent months includes the release of an important report from the Western
Australian Government. The report is titled "WA Vaccine Safety Surveillance - Annual Report 2021".

Please consider Section 3.1 of the report "Summary ofAEFI reports, Figure 2". See Figure 1 below.

In 2020 the rate of reported vaccine injury per vaccine (pre-COVID inoculants) was 13 per 100,000
vaccines administered. In 2021 the rate of reported vaccine injury was 264 per 100,000 for the
novel COVID immunisation drugs. This did not include a full year of the novel inoculants.

The chart below from the WA report illustrates in graphic form the change in total vaccine injury in
WA in the period 2017 thru 2021.

Figure 1: Section 3.1 of the WA VSS Annual Report "Summary ofAEFI reports, Figure 2".

Does the Inquiry consider these rates of injury from the novel inoculants to be acceptable? Is it also
possible some deaths passed unreported associated with inoculation. Prima facie, as explored later
in this advisory, the adverse events system appears to be set up to ensure the injured and the dead
are required to lodge their own reports. Does such a system lead to effective levels of reporting?

The deaths metadata in Figure 2 (from ABS data) indicate that much worse is yet to be revealed in
the 2022 vaccine injury data. The author suggests the Inquiry focus on injuries in January/February
2022. The author recommends the Inquiry gain access to the "as yet unpublished" 2022 WA data to
assist in deliberations for the suspension of the COVID inoculation program. The meta-statistical
implications highlighted in Figure 2 should be enough to motivate the Inquiry to establish the facts.
After the Inquiry has established the facts from the 2022 WA report, this will assist frame the
imperative (or otherwise) for the novel drug manufacturers to be exposed to normal avenues of
litigation and compensation for the supply of products that injure and kill recipients in the future.

The British Medical Journal has reported research indicating that in respect of "serious vaccine
injury", only 1 in 10 (10%) of the serious inoculant injuries are likely to be reported and recorded.
(Recently published research papers indicate this reporting number could be as low as 2%.)

If 90% underreporting is indeed the case, then the total serious injuries from the application of these
COVID drugs in WA is 2,640 per 100,000 which, if extrapolated to the nation, (65m doses claimed
administered) would indicate that as many as 1,716,000 Australians suffered a serious novel
"vaccine" injury or death.

This number begins to tally with a personal family statistical experience tabled later in this
submission.

The WA data and extrapolation is also consistent with the metadata and derivative hypotheses
advised monthly by the author to the Minister for Health for each of the past 15 months.

In the week-ending 24 March 2023, "Our World in Data" reports that a great many Australians were
still being inoculated with these COVID drugs. Does that correlate with government information?
Listed below are the latest reports of daily jabs for Australia and some other nations.

Australian Government continues to spend taxpayer money on a program that some other
responsible nations have apparently abandoned?

2.2 Responsible action

The author encourages the Inquiry to urge the Minister for Health to take the Western Australian
injury data and re-run the COVID risk assessments and associated benefit-cost of the ongoing
promotion of the novel mRNA and adenovirus vector inoculants to the Australian population. Surely
this information is a central element of informed consent. If the Department of Health has data at
this time, that is in future proven to show that the risk of injury from the vaccine is now greater than
the benefit, then is the behaviour of the health professors and doctors involved in perpetuating this
drug experiment in keeping with key tenants of the Hippocratic Oath?

Once the Minister for Health has conducted this risk/benefit/cost assessment it should be provided
to the Australian people as the basis for "informed consent" to the current and ongoing promotion
of the COVID inoculation program.

The author also requests the Inquiry to recommend that the Minister release the microdata for
deaths in the past 3.5 years including vaccine status of all people dying. Earlier advice is that the
Dept does not have the data. (Attachment 3.)

When this microdata is finally released Australian analysts will be wary to avoid the "gaslighting"
problems identified in the UK when the data was made available, (see Footnote 1)

2.3 Vaccine advisory guidance changes

On 5 September 2023 the UK Government updated a decision summary report in respect of the
Public Assessment Report for COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech. The words used advise:




This official UK decision to change vaccine advice for pregnant and breastfeeding women (previously
categorised as vulnerable and therefore prioritised to be inoculated) is significant.

On 23 September 2023 the UK Government updated a decision summary report in respect of the
Pfizer inoculant. The words used advise (and do not include the word "rare" or "unusual"):




                                                                                               Page 11 of 51

The author encourages the Inquiry to ask the Department of Health if it has examined the rate of
Australian neonatal deaths in 2021 and 2022 against historical expectations, while accounting for the
drug status of mothers? If the Dept, has examined this important mortality indicator, could the
public be advised of the findings? If this mortality has not been investigated, does the Inquiry
consider that it warrants enquiry?

Pfizer themselves stated in a press release on 27/01/23 (link below) in respect of important safety
information for their COVID inoculant products that potential recipients should (among other things)
tell their vaccine provider if they:

        -             "Are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding."
        -   "Have had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation
            of the lining outside the heart)"

https://www.pfizer.com/news/announcements/pfizer-responds-research-claims

The unanswered question remains. How does the Inquiry interpret the inclusion by Pfizer of
pregnancy as a risk factor in the safe use of the listed drugs? Does the Inquiry believe Pfizer could be
blame shifting natural responsibility to Governments (providers) in the use of these words?

As the parents of 3 daughters of current childbearing potential the authors' family are actively
seeking an answer from Australian Govt, as to whether advice is under review to determine the
ongoing designation of Australian pregnant women as vulnerable and therefore of high priority for
having these novel drugs? Is the Inquiry able to assist with an answer to this question?



3     A personal COVID story

3.1 Preamble - early exposure to C0VID19

The author and the authors wife are a classic case study of the development of negative inoculant
sentiment. Following is the story in more detail (written in the first person).

In January 2020 my wife and I, while visiting our daughter in       contracted a "disease" from our
son-in-law                                      On reflection and based on the symptoms, by March
2020 (back in Australia) we hypothesised it was the COVID Wuhan strain. We had a story to tell. We
wanted to help assist the Government to gain understanding of this "killer disease", however we
were outlawed from antibody testing for confirmation by Australian emergency legislation designed
to control the medical profession. (Refer                                  I) There was apparently no
interest in our case! From then-on I developed deep distrust. The more I learn the more I distrusted
the Government, experts, the medical profession and MSM.

The issue was not that we claimed to have had COVID (which may or may not have been correct).
The issue was that we were outlawed from establishing the fact and no one wanted to know.




                                                                                              Page 12 of 51
                                                                 231215 - PFParadice COVID Kruk lnquiry 2023




The narrative propagated at the time was that infection with the virus did not confer improved
immunity for the subject person against serious disease, hospitalisation, or death compared to a
person who was uninoculated and naive to the disease. This narrative never really made sense to
people with the most rudimentary understanding of science who viewed such claims with deep
scepticism. It turned out to be an incorrect hypothesis. In the current lexicon it was misinformation.

Peer reviewed research has since supported the hypothesis that viral infection confers immunity
superior to that which is derived from a manmade spike protein inoculant.

An Israeli trial, (follow the link) involving the Delta variant and the Pfizer vaccine concluded that
"individuals who have had the SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from covid-19
vaccination" and "naturally acquired immunity confers stronger protection against infection and
symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 2-dose
vaccine-indued immunity".

The grave implications for this narrative and the consequent unnecessary application of high-risk
drugs to those who had been exposed to the virus are discussed elsewhere in this submission.

3.2 Family matters - the dead and injured

In my immediate family (the total group is about 16) the following people had the following
coincidental events after having the inoculant. The author has been widely advised that correlation
is not causation, and the author gathers now, from other "experts", the author is most likely
suffering from a mental condition known as "causal hunger" in trying to understand these afflictions.

        Mother           - 2 weeks following 2nd inoculation -                - hospitalized
        stent fitted. (Correlation does not mean causation!)

                                 :or 36 months (ongoing) following inoculations. Hands and wrists in
        pain and powerless. Only accepted 2nd inoculant for possibility of travelling to see
        granddaughter in         Refuses any further inoculations. She has aged significantly in this
        time. (Correlation does not mean causation!)

        Daughter ■                             after having 2nd mRNA inoculant. Diagnosed by
        doctor wit               Refuses further inoculation. (Correlation does not mean causation!)

Peripheral to the authors immediate family the author is aware of the following reaction.

    •       Nephew            Developed intense^^^^^| after first mRNA inoculant. He hid from
        further inoculations and remains in hiding. (Correlation does not mean causation!)

These people (names can be supplied) were previously robust and healthy. What they think
happened to them is irrelevant. None of these issues were logged as adverse events. Why would
doctors not get involved with the patient to log these officially as temporal relational adverse
events?

Two fit, work associates              ) were both given a Pfizer booster from the same batch at
in January 2022. (Please examine the chart in Figure 2 for excess deaths in that period.) Within a
week they were both hospitalised i                          one with a^^^Bepisode requiring



                                                                                                Page 13 of 51
                                                               231215 - PFParadice COVID Kruk lnquiry 2023



          the other with                  other^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^that required treatment
over many months. Those hospitalised and the person who insisted on them taking the booster to
retain employment, now believe or suspect it was the vaccine. Neither episode was logged as an
adverse event. (We all now know that correlation does not mean causation!)

I can also refer you to others in my immediate circle who suffered long term injury and continue to
suffer. My sister-in-law recounted a story recently of her sister-in-law (who worked as a US hospital
chaplain until the end) who died of                 2022 (cause unknown) in her sixties. Her name
was^^^The author was told about six (6) causal options proffered by experts as possible
explanations however the conclusion was "cause unknown". (Again, correlation does not mean
causation!)

A person very close to me is a senior nursing sister and helps run a nursing home of about 20
residents. She is in her mid-sixties and has seen many people die in her time in nursing. She
considers she knows when the time is up in aged people. I believe she is competent.

One Saturday afternoon in 2021 they "rounded up" (her words) all the residents in the home and
inoculated them for COVID. In the morning two of the residents were dead. Her comment was that
both these women were happy and well on Saturday night and "it was not their time". The author
was advised that ALL the staff in that nursing facility believe the inoculation immediately killed 2 out
of 20 of their residents in the application of the drug.

When I encouraged her to speak out and log the events, she said they were all fearful of losing their
jobs. That fear remains. They will not speak. I believe these deaths were not logged as adverse
events. How could these events not be logged? Had the residents tested positive for COVID - would
they NOT have been certified as COVID deaths?

Many people do not want to discuss COVID "vax" issues for fear of ridicule and vilification. Why?

The question is not that these people believe (or not) that these "rare" events were related to
inoculation, the question is how could they not be officially logged with the temporal association?



3.3 Personal and private wreckage - microcosm of a nation

If this experience is a microcosm of the Australian population, then by extrapolation 1 in 4 people
had an adverse event to the inoculants. If 20m people have been inoculated then extrapolating from
the microcosm, 5m people will have had some form of adverse event. Even if the ratio is 1 in 20,
then Im people will have had adverse events.

It seems inconceivable that if between Im and 5m people in Australia had adverse events, then
some significant proportion, who are old and/or with relatively weak immune systems, would not
have died from adverse side-effects.

The Minister for Health (July 2022 Attachment 2) advised personally in a response letter that no
more than 13 deaths (it is understood the TGA has since conceded 14) throughout Australia have
been linked to the "vaccines". In light of the fact that there were net excess deaths (ie excess deaths
less those attributed death with COVID) of more than 40,000 people in the 30months after the
rollout began, is it possible the Ministerial advice could be inconsistent with the statistics?




                                                                                              Page 14 of 51
                                                             231215 - PFParadice COVID Kruk lnquiry 2023




What may appear complicated could be simplified if the Dept, released for public scrutiny the
inoculation history micro-data for all deaths since the rollout began. Some pre-rollout micro-data
would also be necessary. Age adjustment can be done. Smart analysts could run regressions to test
the significance of the inoculants as an independent variable in the mix leading to death. Perhaps
the models have already been built and for that reason the data will never be released. The Inquiry
should ask the Dept, to supply the micro-data for the Inquiry to analyse. If the data supported the
orthodox narrative, why would it not be out and about? (The statistics the author has personally
derived from ABS metadata should be distressing. Why is no one distressed?)

Based on ABS figures, in the 30 months following the mRNA vaccine rollout more than 40,000 excess
deaths have occurred in Australia against the pre-COVID five (5) year benchmark expectation.

It is now widely propagated by IVISM that excess deaths have been caused only by "missed GP
appointments" due to lockdown and the myopic industry focus on COVID cases.

Is it possible that the cause unknown underlying 40,000+ excess deaths is the same cause unknown
driving injuries some claim (rarely) from the inoculants?

Because people must remain silent about the unknown cause/s the author attaches a surrogate
Australian "public trust" chart in Attachment 1 for your consideration.

The "trust chart" indicates that at the end of March 2023 only a fraction the Australian population
were up to date and effectively "PROTECTED" from COVID by the novel, man-made inoculant drugs.

If we ruminate for a moment on the unspeakable "Cause Unknown" and the population trust chart,
then perhaps we might understand the insight of the many sceptical Australians into this
government sponsored experiment. They are resisting ongoing coercion. Why might that be?

Even in the absence of leadership, the public seem to have made a decision that is not in alignment
with the business ambitions of the drug makers, the WHO, the Government, and other elite
beneficiaries of the pandemic.

It is accepted that COVID was widespread before Christmas 2022. In fact, the authors parents (both
in their 90's) were labelled with COVID in November 2022 and the side effects of the anti-viral drugs
they were given seemed worse than the disease. (The orthodox narrative premise is it's a deadly
disease vs the now known real world reality.)

If inoculant damage is "rare" then the Paradice family and friends have been extremely unlucky to
experience such a high incidence of "rare" coincidences of illness and injury in temporal proximity
following inoculation.

Some see COVID inoculation as an ongoing experiment using taxpayer money to pay for high-risk
drugs that are ineffective against an irrelevant virus.


4     Excess deaths and injuries

4.1 Excess deaths, cause unknown!

A significantly greater number of Australians died in the 30month period to July 2023 than could
have been expected to die. Of the 52,519 excess deaths in the period more than 42,712 died of a



                                                                                            Page 15 of 51
                                                                   231215 - PFParadice COVID Kruk lnquiry 2023




"cause unknown". The author understands the Government currently acknowledges 14 of these
deaths were related to COVID vaccine injury. We look forward to the Inquiry proposing a credible
explanation for the underlying cause of death for the other 42,698 people.

Appendix A details the statistics accumulated from the ABS mortality data releases that have
supplied data back to early 2020. Appendix D graphically details excess deaths by age and sex for the
most affected cohorts. While many females and males over the age of 84 died from a "cause
unknown" between January 2021 and May 2023, in the month leading up to end July 2023 the
excess deaths in this cohort have returned to the Syr baseline. However, both females and males
between the age of 65 and 84 are the groups that currently continue to die at a remarkably higher
rate than expected. (Figures 11 & 12.)


4.2 ABS changes to the baseline for comparisons, present to past - 2023

In the ABS provisional mortality statistics (release 26/05/23) the ABS made the following statement
under the heading "Baseline comparison". (Baselines are based on calendar years.)

"The purpose of a baseline is to provide a typical year (or combination of years) to compare the
current year to. Deaths for 2023 will have two comparisons points - they will be compared to both
deaths occurring in 2022 and a baseline period consisting of the average number of deaths occurring
in the years of 2017-2019, 2021."

While the reported death rates meandered along in the 5 years until December 2019 (2015-2019)
there was effectively:

                     -   no change in Australian death rates in 2020 (virus but no vaxx),
                     -   a significant increase in 2021 (virus and vaxx), and
                     -   an extraordinary significant increase in 2022 (virus, vaxx and boosters).

The effect of comparing deaths to baseline (2017-2019, 2021) for 2023 was to:

                     -   change the weighting of the baseline from 5 to 4 years,
                     -   drop off two average years (2015-2016),
                     -   replace two average years with one spike year thereby dragging up the
                         baseline mortality rates significantly,
                     -   normalise excess deaths.

The effect of comparing deaths to baseline (2022) for 2023 was to:

                     -   compare a year with highest excess deaths on record (most from cause
                         unknown) with a year when things were expected to settle back,
                     -   make the present (2023) look much better than the past, and
                     -   indicate that excess deaths were on retreat (not true from 2015-2019).

The Inquiry should consider why the ABS would change the baseline in this way. There were other
options open to ensure excess deaths against baseline were more effectively assessed.

One theory is that if the "cause unknown" excess deaths are normalised into the baseline then
difficult questions are less likely to arise. The Inquiry should advise Australians if ABS were given



                                                                                                  Page 16 of 51

advice or input from the Dept, of Health or others in establishing the new baselines as the numbers
arising in 2023 were compared to the past.


4.3 Rare injuries

To maintain the national underlying premise (of vaccine infallibility) we must all discount people
claiming "rare" injuries attributed to the novel inoculants and consider that most people
apportioning blame to the novel drugs do so because of a "causal hunger" or conspiracy theory.

The author continues to seek to understand "rare" as it is used in the context as reported by MSM
and Governments in respect of this matter. Figure 3 depicts one of many Australian fields of sorrow.
Passersby may wonder what is going on. The author invites the Inquiry to apportion meaning to the
photo and keep it in mind when formulating advice.




Figure 3 Field of sorrow silently informing of rare vaccine injuries at Shoalhaven Heads


4.4 COVID death misappropriation

In August 2023 an explanatory model was developed by the author to test the hypothesis that
"many COVID attributed mortalities are a misappropriation from other causes of death".

The model compares the net expected increase in deaths for the "unusual" deficit mortality
categories with actual mortalities logged to create a negative mirror image to the COVID deaths. In
past Ministerial advisories this element has been one of the least explored points in the analysis. The



                                                                                                          Page 17 of 51
                                                                            231215 - PFParadice COVID Kruk lnquiry 2023




alignment of these calculations fortifies the view that COVID as a viral agent is less remarkable than
flu/pneumonia. There were 1,536 flu deaths in the same period.

The "missing deaths" graph in Figure 4 below indicates that "as a rule, for each COVID attributed
death there is an equal and opposite (missing, predicted) death from the combined background
morbidity classes of respiratory, ischaemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular issues."

In the model the "missing deaths" will logically be understated as the multiplier derived from the
average changed in doctor certified deaths (DCD) includes the supressing influence of the
cerebrovascular, respiratory and isch. heart classifications which have generally been negative in the
study period.

Once the reader grasps this concept then other hypotheses and conclusions logically follow.

4.5 Trust and confidence

When indemnity protection is removed for manufacturers of the COVID inoculant drugs, only if
product safety is reasonably defensible, will the manufacturers of these drugs continue to supply the
COVID "vaccines" from use in the Australian market. Based on the decision by Pfizer to not supply
India with these novel drugs without Government indemnity in 2021, it seems plausible that some of
these novel drug products will be withdrawn from supply in Australia if indemnity is removed.

The author prefers to label the novel mRNA and adenovirus vector drugs as inoculants rather than
vaccines. One view is they should not be confused with, or compared to, the old tried and trusted
vaccines. The author considers that to do so could be counterproductive in the long run. The Inquiry
should consider if it is possible that such comparisons are fostering unreasonable negative sentiment
against all vaccines? Is this happening now in Australia? What does the data indicate?

4.6 Motivations of proponents of novel COVID inoculants

The author has become aware that many claiming "known" current and future safety of the novel
inoculates have received research funding from the World Health Organisation and/or have material
relationships (sometimes thru many distant intermediaries) with manufacturers of novel mRNA or
adenovirus vector "vaccines". Personal research indicates that many promoters have little idea of
the science and are motivated primarily by funding.

The clip below with immunologist Professor^^^Jeads the author to believe that most Australian
proponents of the novel inoculants do not know what they are talking about. The author encourages
the Inquiry to consult Professor^^^Jin person in its search for the truth.

https://youtu.be/ylVlyERFBdB4E (YouTube^|& Professo^^^H discuss mRNA
technology.)

Based on their public prognostications, the author encourages the Inquiry to examine the underlying
financing arrangements of key proponents from the TGA, the Gavan Institute, the Kirby Institute, the
University of Sydney, the Melbourne University, Monash University and The Australian Actuaries
Institute.

As more excess deaths data is revealed, less noise is heard from individuals working at the
institutions listed above as the emerging scale of the problem becomes apparent.


5     Conclusions

The Inquisitors should set aside all the earlier information tabled and focus on just two questions.

There were ten (10) people mentioned in the story above (Section 3.2) who were injured of died
soon after being jabbed with the novel drugs. There was a strong temporal connection to the
"vaccine". What they believe is irrelevant. What the writer believes is irrelevant. Many people
around them considered that they were vaccine injured or killed. The doctors involved appear to
have ignored the temporal association and left the injured and dead to report events themselves.
Without these sorts of events being logged there is no possibility of establishing the true frequency
of vaccine injury and death. Distrust reigns among the associated living. Doctors become suspects.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, not even one of these 10 cases were logged as an adverse
event. Why would the system be designed against it?

The calculations (attached spreadsheet) from ABS data estimate that in the first SOmonths following
rollout (Feb 2021 to 30/07/23) the most supportable number of unexpected (unexplained)
Australian deaths in all cohorts was 42,712. We know the Government has now recognised 14
deaths linked to COVID vaccine injury. Is the Inquiry able to discover and reveal to the Australian
people what caused the other 42,698 deaths?

Figure 5: Weekly excess deaths Jan2020/2021/2022/2023 vs Syear benchmark background -ABS release 30 July 2023



While calendar year 2021 excess weekly total deaths increases were a significant cause for concern,
since January 2022, another larger rise in "unexplained" deaths occurred. (See Figure 5 and Figure 6)
From 2022 the ABS changed the comparison baseline from the Syear average to 2019 (used until the
end of 2021) to a hybrid baseline, the consequences of which are discussed in Section 4.2 in the
SUBMISSION above. However, when the Syear average baseline to 2019 is used for total deaths, the
following numbers appear for the period January 2022 thru July 2023 and are represented in the
graphs in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The numbers are remarkable in their magnitude.




                                                          22
        Expected total deaths for Jan22/July23 (Syr baseline)              251,950
        Actual total deaths for Jan22/July23                               294,662
        Difference in total deaths Jan22/July23 (above Syr averages)        42,712 = Excess deaths
        COVID attributed deaths Jan22/July23                                12,971
        Unexplained excess deaths Jan22/July23 (minimum)                    29,741

        Excess total deaths, vax rollout day 1 thru 30 July23 (120 wks)   52,519
        COVID attributed deaths during vax rollout period (120 wks)       13,473
        Excess deaths LESS COVID deaths (all attributed)                  39,046 > than expected
        Excess deaths LESS COVID deaths (5% of DCD attributed)            51,820 > than expected

The ABS indicate that people certified as having died of COVID, on average, had 3 additional chronic
comorbidities and only 5% of those dying of COVID had COVID19 recorded as the sole cause of
death. It is not unreasonable to assume that other COVID attributed mortalities may have been
caused by co-morbidities or THE "Cause Unknown".

The data indicate that since the start of the vaccine rollout (to 30 July 2023), approx. 42,519 more
total deaths occurred than were expected.

The non-COVID excess DCD deaths were statistically attributed to, cancer, dementia, diabetes, and
other disease classes with death rates generating "overs and unders" against expected rates in
different mortality classes.

Data from commencement of vaccine rollout (7 February 2021 thru 30 July 2023)

Attached is a spreadsheet with ABS deaths data for the 30month period from 7 February 2021 thru
30 July 2023. The ABS also report deaths broken down by some mortality classifications. "Old age" is
not included as a mortality class. In July 2023 the ABS commenced reporting an additional class
being "Other cardiac". It has not been introduced into this report, however preliminary and there
are ongoing indications (+14% increase in the past 30 weeks against the hybrid baseline) that the
data supports the hypotheses postulated in this report. The specific "death by morbidity"
classifications are listed below.

        MORTALITY LIST A
        -         Cancer
        -         Cerebrovascular
        -         Respiratory
        -         Dementia
        -         Diabetes
        -         Ischaemic heart disease

When the past 30months ABS data is processed (7 Feb 2021 thru 30 July 2023) by total deaths and
the primary morbidity-mortality classes against the Syear baseline average the following insights
emerge:

    A. Expected total deaths (30months) from all causes + old age         401,032
    B. Actual total deaths (30months) from all causes + old age           453,551
    C. Excess deaths from cancer, dementia & diabetes                     19,249 -more than expected
    D. Excess deaths from cerebrov., resp., isch. heart                   (4,808) - less than expected
    E. Deaths attributed to COVID-19 (for 130 wks)                         13,975
    F. Actual deaths from COVID-19 no comorbidity (5% of E above)             699

Data from the 2021 COVID "attributed" deaths resurgence (5 July 2021) thru 30 July 2023

Following Australia's isolation, COVID attributed deaths began appearing in the weekly data from the
report dated EOW 11 July 2021. The data for the following 107week period until end July 2023
revealed the following two numbers.



                                                            24
        Deaths attributed to COVID-19 (for 107weeks)                      13,971
        Excess deaths from cerebrovasc., resp., influenza, isch. heart   (4,808) less than expected

In other words, in the 107week period beginning 05/07/21 a partial inverse pattern to COVID deaths
(negative actual against expected) emerges for the combined morbidity-mortality classifications of:

        MORTALITY LIST B (Subset of LIST A)
        -         Cerebrovascular
        -         Respiratory
        -         Ischaemic heart disease

In the same "107week" time frame, deaths attributed to the morbidity-mortality classifications of
cancer, dementia, and diabetes, increased by 16,698 people.

So, what could it all mean?

The Key Numbers

The key takeaway numbers from the Australian deaths ABS metadata to 30/07/23 are:

        -            52,519 excess deaths were reported from vax. rollout day-1 thru 30 July 2023 (Ref
            Figure 6),
        -            There were13,975COVID attributed deaths from vax. rollout day-1 thru 30 July 2023,
        -            There were38,544excess deaths after deducting all those attributed to COVID-19,
        -            There were51,820excess deaths after deducting NET1 COVID-19 deaths of those dying
            without co-contributing comorbidities (Figure 8),
        -   There were (4,414) LESS deaths from cerebrovascular, respiratory, and ischaemic heart
            from 5 July 2021 thru 30 July 2023 (a negative inverse to COVID accounting directly for
            approx. 32% of COVID appropriated deaths however if mortality is adjusted to account
            for the missing anticipated increases in these groups, plus the observed deficit, a mirror
            image to the COVID attributed deaths is revealed - see Figure 9),
        -   Deducting deaths of those dying with contributory co-morbidity then far fewer COVID
            attributed deaths could arguably be considered to have been from COVID as the
            primary cause from 20 September 2021 thru 30 July 2023,
        -   There were 19,249 more deaths than expected from 5 July 2021 thru 30 July 2023 from
            cancer, dementia & diabetes, and
        -   There were 21,734 more deaths than expected from 5 July 2021 thru 30 July 2023 from
            the "cause unknown", old age or causes other than the primary ABS mortality
            classifications discussed above.

7.2 Appendix B. The "Cause Unknown" and Virus Activity Hypotheses


Hypotheses, reasonably postulated from the ABS numbers for Australia (and that require testing by
examination of the microdata) are:

       -   The "Cause Unknown" shortened the lives of (killed) at least 38,544 and as many as
           52,519 Australians since the start of the "vaccine" rollout (130 weeks),
       -           44,512 is calculated to be the most likely estimate of Australian people in all cohorts
           who had their lives shortened by THE "Cause Unknown" in the 130 weeks to 30 July
           2023. (The ratio of total excess deaths is 1 excess death per 1,465 inoculants applied.
           Remarkably this ratio has also been recorded for the UK and the USA.)
       -   Ongoing "Cause Unknown" intervention continues to shorten the lives of people across
           most age groups,
       -           95% of deaths attributed to COVID had co-contributing comorbidities (ABS comorbidity
           rates),
       -           Attributed COVID deaths can be logically calculated to be lower than official claims,
       -   Older patients testing positive for COVID were in many cases "written off" and treated
           with "end-of-life" programs or euthanasia type interventions (or had lifesaving
           interventions withheld) that contributed to their demise,
       -   Novel COVID "vaccines" don't stop viral spread or infection (the antithesis of initial
           Government coercion declaring "a pandemic of the unvaccinated"), and,
       -   Temporal regression modelling of the extra 9,834 cancer deaths indicates a correlation
           between mRNA "vaccine" application and increased cancer deaths (+9% and climbing)
           which could indicate a possible causal relationship. The relationship is 30 deaths per Im
           doses lagged 120days. (The association since the commencement of the experiment is
           154 extra cancer deaths per Im doses. However, on the basis that 21m people were
           inoculated with an average of 3 doses of "vaccine" then the direct correlation is an extra
           462 cancer deaths per Im people given the 3dose course of COVID drug treatment.)

7.3 Appendix C. The Logical COVID Conclusions


If the hypotheses logically formulated on the metadata are supported by the microdata (unavailable
to-date for independent examination), then the following conclusions might reasonably be drawn
from the Australian COVID experience.

        -   The Government unreasonably overstated the danger of the COVID virus (any variant).
        -   With wilful ignorance and in the face of evolving facts, the Government, and mainstream
            media unreasonably terrified and coerced the nation into accepting inoculation with the
            novel vaccines.
        -   Many older Australians testing positive for COVID were largely "written off" and left to
            die from what now appears to have been an unremarkable and treatable illness. (This
            boosted the statistics for the COVID death rates.)
        -   A "Cause Unknown" shortened the lives of (and continues to shorten the lives of) many
            vulnerable and healthy Australians. (Refer Figure 8)
        -   Statistically, the virus as a sole agent in shorten the lives of people who died with COVID
            attribution is questionable.
        -            The novel COVID "vaccines" are implicated in significantly increased rates of cancer.

Therefore, if these conclusions are eventually supported by the microdata, then the benefits will be
seen to not outweigh the costs in applying these drugs (the misnamed novel COVID "vaccines") to
any cohort of the Australian population.

If the conclusions are eventually supported by the microdata could the Inquiry establish who will
take responsibility for this awful human experiment?

Some of the people in key positions who should be invited to take responsibility for the

In Australia, information on deaths from COVIC-19 Is collected through disease surveillance
systems, such as the National interoperable Notifiable Disease*Surveillance System, and
civil registration systems, such as the ABS COVID-19 mortality data. ABS data 1$ not directly
comparable with data sourced from health surveillance systems, which are designed to
release information rapidly on both Infections and mortality.

The TGA continues to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations. The current evidence
demonstrates that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines available In Australia continue to

Thank you for writing on this matter.

           Department of Health



                                                                       Acting Deputy Secretary




         Peter Paractice




         Dear Mr Paradice,

         Australian vaccine adverse event reporting, compensation claims and ABS excess
         moitalitv statistics

         Thank you for your correspondence dated 30 March 2022, which was forwarded to
         me as it relates to excess deaths, I note that you have expressed concern for, and
         sought assistance with LUTderstanding, 2020-21 Australian Death Data published by
         the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

         We have been working with the ABS to understand then mortality' reports, and the
         processes by which they have been compiled. We are also working with the ABS
         mortalit’.- data to integrate and further analyse deaths over the COVID-19 period,
         including understanding the range of potential contributors to mortality from
         specific causes. We are currently developing and validating analysis methodologv
         before we can produce findings that can be shared more widely.

         Excess mortality as an epidemiological concept, is defined as the difference between
         the observed and expected number of deaths in a specified time-period. Excess
         mortality calculations are used to observe whether mortality rates have deviated
         from trends seen in preceding years. In particular, this can be used to assess if deaths
         from specific cattses (e g. C0VID-19), conditions or other circumstances (such as
         environmental factors) have caused annual mortality rates to go beyond expected
         levels.

         It is important to note that excess mortality figures can be calculated in many ways,
         arid the ABS have their' own specific methods. Dre ABS publishes two regular
         reports covering excess deaths in Australia:
                                  Ptwna:          ansa:
                                                                              - ■mw.HBaltn.gcv.ai




                                                   41
                                              -2­
   1. The first report., named' Provisional Mortality Statistics', appears to be the source of
      the figures you analysed. Tlus publication utilises preliminary counts of doctor
      certified deaths by date of occunence to calculate average mortality rates over a
      specified time-period.
   2. The second report, named 'Measuring Australia's excess mortality during the
      COVID-19 pandemic', is based on the Serfling model. This model takes into account
      seasonality and trends over the pas t three years,, and consequently presents
      contrasting .figures to the Provisional Mortality Statistics report.


I encourage you to analyse both reports to obtain, a more complete understanding of
excess mortality in Australia.

The ABS are currently your best point of contact to describe how data has been used
to model excess deaths, as well as how to interpret deaths that are excess to their
expected ranges. The ABS website provides some details of methodologies used (e.g.
the Serfling model, seasonal averaging), or alternatively specific enquiries can be sent
to |

Unfortunately, we are unable to provide the unit record death data you requested, as
this data can only be compiled through data linkage from various Commonwealth
and state-based datasets which we do not have access to. We are continuously
working to ensure relevant aggregate death statistics and research outputs are made
accessible to the public.

Thank you once again for your interest in this data.

Yours sincerely

ln many cases they report conditions that have occurred following vaccination
regardless of whether they suspect it was caused by vaccination. These reports are
initially made to their state or territory health department, who then report them to
the TGA.

With this in mind, I agree with you that an extrapolation to 4.5 million unreported
adverse events is just not possible. As you point out, this hypothesis is not supported
by evidence of our health systems being overcome by requirements to treat that
volume of vaccine injuries.

The TGA comprehensively evaluated each of the provisionally registered COVID-19
vaccines before approval. No element of the evaluation is rushed, and no data are
overlooked. It is a similar process to that undertaken by other major regulators,
including the European Medicines Agency and Health Canada.

TGA staff with expertise in medicine, biostatistics and epidemiology undertake
analysis of adverse event report data to detect signals for possible safety' concerns.
Investigations of these safety' signals aim to distinguish between coincidental events
and side effects that may be caused by the vaccines. When these investigations
confirm a safety' issue, we take prompt action to address the issue and provide
information to the public.

To date no international regulator has identified any association between Vaxzevria
and heart disease and it is not included in the Product Information which contains
the most update to date safety information for a medicinal product.

The TGA has been publishing a weekly COVID-19 vaccine safety' report for over 10
months. Each report contains clear, accurate and up-to-date information about die
TGA's safety monitoring activities, including details of its scientific and evidence­
based evaluations of serious adverse events and deaths reported for COVID-19
vaccines. The reports are available on our website at:
www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report .

1 hope the above information helps to reassure you that the TGA's safety monitoring
of COVID-19 vaccines is effectively protecting the Australian public.

Yours sincerely

         Mr Peter Para dice




        Dear Mr Paradice

        I refer to your correspondence of 16 September 2021 to the Deputy Prime Minister,
        ■ 'e -: "                 :     ' :e • - 5 A.,st-al a’: -esc: - se r :■ erne-5    “ rias of SC V ~
        As the Department of Health is responsible for Australia's COVID-19 health response, your
        letter has been referred to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon^^^^^ MP'
        The Minister has asked me to reply.

        Evidence regarding variants is being closely monitored by experts, such as Communicable
        Diseases Network Australia, Communicable Diseases Genomics Network, and the Australian
        Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) to inform our public health response and
        protect the Australian population.


        Australia's goal, as recommended by AHPPC, was suppression of COVID-19 with no
        community transmission. This strategy recognised that outbreaks continued to remain a
        risk. Maintaining that goal requires active case find Ing and contact tracing, targeted testing
        □f the affected population, public health and social measures and personal measures.

        Elimination was never a goal of Australia's COVID-19 pandemic response. In the absence of
        high amounts of immunity in the population both in Australia and globally, elimination is not
        a realistic short term goal, in the short term when there are outbreaks of the virus as
        vaccination coverage is going up, it is still important to suppress transmission of the virus
        where possible.

        In the longer term, elimination at a global level will only be feasible if there is high
        vaccination coverage across a majority of countries, in reality it might take a few rounds of
        booster shots to get there but if not the more likely scenario remains that the virus is likely
        to stay around for some time.

        SARS-CoV-2 remains a Listed Human Disease under the Biosecurity Act 2015 and as
        vaccination coverage increases the use of public health measures in lieu of using lockdown
        will still be needed as outlined in the National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID
        Response (National Plan} informed by the Doherty modelling.

                                              2
The National Plan provides a graduated pathway to transition Australia's COVID-19 response
from its current pre-vaccination settings focused on continued suppression of community
transmission, to post-vaccination settings focused on prevention of serious illness and
fatalities, whereby the public health management of COVID-19 is consistent with other
infectious diseases.

The safety of the Australian population has always been the highest priority of the
Government. For this reason, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccines have been guided by
the expert medical advice of the AustralianTechnical Advisory Group on Immunisation.


The goal is to protect all people in Australia from the harm caused by COVID-19 infection,
through preventing serious illness and death, and where possible, disease transmission. The
Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Modema vaccines have all been proven through
approval and safety monitoring processes to be very effective at reducing severe illness,
hospitalisation, and death.

In addition, to better support Australians though the COVID-19 vaccination process, the
Government is developing the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme (the Scheme). On
28 August 2021, the Minister announced further details of the Scheme, which will provide
Australians with an alternative, administrative option to seek compensation, rather than
through a complex and costly court process. The Scheme will cover the costs of injuries
$5,000 and above due to a proven adverse reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine or its
administration.


Furthermore, as part of the Government's Nst cr al Z desre u.     1Ist:^ •" ?  • CC V D--?
serosurveillance is one of the key surveillance approaches adopted to inform understanding
of population level immunity to SARS-CoV-2. To date, seroprevalence surveys have been
undertaken by the Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease
Emergencies and led by the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance in
coIlla boration with the Kirby Institute.


The Department of Health is considering future national level serosurvey requirements and
appropriate timing. The role of future national serosurveys in understanding population
level immunity will be an important surveillance tool, including with regarding to measuring
vaccination coverage, to guide public health measures.

I wish to assure you that the Australian, state and territory governments are working
together to coordinate an evidence-based response to COVID-19, based on the latest
medical advice. Together these actions have placed us in a good position globally.

Thank you for writing on this matter.

Yours sincerely

Dear

Re: Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry (AKA Restoring Trust in Public Health Inquiry)

Please find attached a submission to the Kruk COVID Inquiry.

This submission seeks to support the Inquiry in the mission to restore trust in public health following
the government performance/s in response to the COVID-19 challenge.

It is my sincere hope that the "Prime Ministers team" will successfully restore the trust of a sceptical
public in the Australian institutions of public health, doctors, and the broader medical profession.

My understanding is that the people picked on the Prime Ministers panel were supportive, in fact
complicit, in formulating and prosecuting the orthodox COVID response. These chosen people have
continued to support novel inoculations for COVID beyond a point where others, without insider
history, may have suspended the intervention and discontinued defending the indefensible.

Appendices and attachments to this submission are "data focused" and were generated using the
ABS mortality data releases up until T1 October 2023 to detail and analyse Australian mortality
statistics since the beginning of the COVID event. There is no discussion herein of "The Science".

I urge the Inquiry to recommend that the Commonwealth Government release the unadulterated
micro-data to test (and hopefully refute) the fearsome hypotheses postulated in this submission.

The data examined in this submission are solid grounds to advise the Government of Australia to
follow the lead of the Swiss authorities in suspending the ongoing COVID inoculation program.

My perception is that many Australians have subdued expectations of this Inquiry. It seems unlikely
Australians will lower their reasonable barriers of distrust until the unbridled truth is revealed.
Findings of the Inquiry, if perceived to be as illogical as the ongoing inoculation program, could
perpetuate or exacerbate the well-founded distrust (scepticism) generated by government in the
COVID years.
There are powerful forces at work that I do not understand.

I see self-censorship instead of open debate. I see "gaslighting" of the injured and supporters of the
dead. I see apparent errors evincing incongruous denialist behaviour in a bureaucracy that simply
doesn't make sense. I see "sacred text" in narratives that are unassailed by clear logic. I hear a
reputable UK research Professor of Immunology warning that ongoing boosting with COVID shots
can "down-regulate" the immune system. I read a Yale research pre-print describing Post-Vaccine
Syndrome which is a euphemism to allow mainstream institutions to consider publishing the
unthinkable.

So, in closing, and in line with the narrative, I urge the Inquirers to "stay safe", trust in Big Pharma,
and what-ever-else, stay up to date with your personal booster shots!

In the annals of Australian history, those who effectively sort this mess out will be remembered as
the heroines of our age.

Good luck.

Yours sincerely,




Peter Paradice

8.8 Attachment 8: Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry
    TOR

Scope
The Inquiry will review the Commonwealth Government’s response to the COVID-19
pandemic and make recommendations to improve response measures in the event
of future pandemics. It will consider opportunities for systems to more effectively
anticipate, adapt and respond to pandemics in areas of Commonwealth Government
responsibility.

The Inquiry will adopt a whole-of-government view in recognition of the wide-ranging
impacts of COVID-19 across portfolios and the community. Specific areas of review
may include, but are not limited to:

   •   Governance including the role of the Commonwealth Government,
       responsibilities of state and territory governments, national governance
       mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination Mechanism
       and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory
       bodies supporting responses to COVID-19.
   •   Key health response measures (for example across COVID-19 vaccinations
       and treatments, key medical supplies such as personal protective equipment,
       quarantine facilities, and public health messaging).
   •   Broader health supports for people impacted by COVID-19 and/or lockdowns
       (for example mental health and suicide prevention supports, and access to
       screening and other preventive health measures).
   •   International policies to support Australians at home and abroad (including
       with regard to international border closures, and securing vaccine supply
       deals with international partners for domestic use in Australia).
   •   Support for industry and businesses (for example responding to supply chain
       and transport issues, addressing labour shortages, and support for specific
       industries).
   •       Financial support for individuals (including income support payments).
   •   Community supports (across early childhood education and care, higher
       education, housing and homelessness measures, family and domestic
       violence measures in areas of Commonwealth Government responsibility).
   •   Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular
       populations (including across genders, age groups, socio-economic status,
       geographic location, people with disability, First Nations peoples and
       communities and people from culturally and linguistically diverse
       communities).

The Inquiry will consider the findings of previous relevant inquiries and reviews and
identify knowledge gaps for further investigation. It will also consider the global
experience and lessons learnt from other countries in order to improve response
measures in the event of future global pandemics.

The following areas are not in scope for the Inquiry:


                                          50
   •      Actions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments.
   •      International programs and activities assisting foreign countries.

Independent Panel
The Prime Inquiry has appointed an Independent Panel of three eminent people to
conduct the Inquiry. The Independent Panel will consult with relevant experts and
people with a diverse range of backgrounds and lived experience.

Taskforce
A Taskforce within the Department of the Prime Inquiry and Cabinet will support the
Independent Panel.

Public consultation
Public consultation will be completed during the Inquiry on the substance of the
issues outlined in the Terms of Reference. The Independent Panel may invite and
publish submissions and seek information from any persons or bodies. Consultation
will take place across Australia with:

   •      Key community and other stakeholders reflecting a diversity of backgrounds
   •      Experts
   •      Commonwealth Government and state and territory government agencies
   •      Members of the public

Final Report
The Independent Panel will deliver a Final Report to Government including
recommendations to the Commonwealth Government to improve Australia’s
preparedness for future pandemics by the end of September 2024.
