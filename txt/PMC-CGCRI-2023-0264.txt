As a parent of two young children I have followed the State and Federal responses to Covid and
continue to do so. Our family shapes our actions/activity around the most up to date independent
research instead.



Unfortunately, the panel presiding over this inquiry does not match this and so I can only add a vote
of no confidence in these people and process. To be marking your own homework, that is misguided
in the first speaks of a process nobody should accept. Independence is needed.



To ignore my qualified Federal member, Dr Ananda-Rajah is deeply troubled.
