The COVID-19 Response Inquiry Panel
Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet



COVID-19 Response Inquiry

First and foremost, I write to request a Royal Commission into Australia's response to COVID-19.

A Royal Commission with the powers and resources to conduct a thorough investigation is a
necessity as the COVID-19 response affected every Australian. Some of the areas requiring
investigation include, but are not limited to:

    •        Vaccine procurement and secrecy around contracts;
    •        Vaccine mandates;
    •        Vaccine injuries;
    •        Mask mandates, lock downs, and social distancing;
    •   Official misinformation and lies in the media regarding asymptomatic spread of respiratory
        viruses;
    •   Official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of social distancing, masks
        and vaccines to block transmission;
    •   Official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the safety and efficacy of
        experimental gene therapy vaccines which could also be classed as toxigenic therapeutics;
    •   Media censorship of opinions from suitably qualified doctors and scientists which ran
        contrary to the official narrative;
    •        The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors and scientists;
    •        The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in the poor treatment of the vaccine injured;
    •        The discouragement of early treatment (contrary to every other medical condition);
    •   The absence of early treatments, including the absence of a taskforce to identify and
        repurpose existing, readily available drugs;
    •   Why the response was ubiquitous for each stratified cohort, given the infection fatality rate
        for each cohort was different;
    •   The collection of data in a way that did not differentiate between infection fatality rate (IFR)
        and case fatality rate (CFR), which would have hampered decision making;
    •        The origins of SARS-CoV-2.

In regard to my final point above, the mere possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could be the result of Gain of
Function (GoF) research ought to be enough to consider a complete, international ban on the
practice. Furthermore, an audit should be conducted into all Commonwealth grants to ensure no
funding is being used for this dangerous practice. To this end, I request that Australian scientists be
banned from participating in GoF research anywhere in the world, with severe criminal penalties
should they do so.
