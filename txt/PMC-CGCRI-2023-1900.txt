OVERVIEW:
A persons health, is their own issue to be responsible for. No external body or authority has any
right to impose anything to do with my health upon my body unless I agree. Anything other is a
violation of my body and my rights. People who have incurred loss resulting from poor judgement
and mandates imposed are to be fully compensated not only for the loss, but also the stress endured
from adapting to life after the loss.
My Situation:
Notwithstanding that I had high levels of COVID anti-bodies in my blood samples from having
previously already contracted COVID, had an exemption letter from a doctor in Indonesia, and the
fact that the Minister for Health in NSW announced on 20 April 2022, that all Mandates were
dropped;                                    I was sacked from my position |
                                                                         | for not being vaccinated
against COVID19.




On this basis I feel I have a strong and well defined case for damages on the basis that the authors
of the Policy were negligent in undertaking a lack of research to justify their claims in the policy as
written. Furthe|and its HR staff are in Breach of Contract (my employment contract)
on the basis that they had relied on the same Fraud for my dismissal from my position.
The level of extortion (black mail) from my employer extended over multiple months. My employer
also insisted that I attend their nominated doctor to seek the exemption.
The NSW health Department (& Minister) and Federal Government and Ministers are Complicit in
the above.


MAKE GOOD DAMAGES:
The result of my dismissal has resulted in damages to my income (Super, Long Service etc),
damage to my reputation and career advancement. At the time of my dismissal I was working on
one of the first and largest                                a relatively new concept that would
have put me at the forefront of employ-ability and working on pushing for H

                  | to be researched and investigated that would have placed me in a totally unique
and employable status. The impact of this needs to be determined in a fair an equitable manner.

My dismissal has undermined my career advancement for which I need to be compensated for
equitably. I have lost two years of wages income (with CPI increases), and associated benefits
(Super, Long Service Leave etc.) I have been placed in an extremely (avoidable) stressful position.


My Position:
Since my sacking on 22 April 2022 my income has been lost, my reputation damaged (by
inference), my career advancement halted and been left very stressed. The complicit actions of the
Federal government, State government, my employer and individuals responsible for the Policy
under which I was sacked are all complicit in perpetrating fraud, extortion and breach of contract
that have caused me damage.

These damages are to be made good, including returning my position of employment, loss of
income and benefits and damages to my mental well being (stress) as a result.




DOCTORS IN AUSTRALIA THREATENED WITH REPRISALS:
I approached a number of doctors in Australia regarding an exemption for the Vaccine, given I
already had an exemption issued by Indonesian doctors on the basis that I have a severe allergy to
Penicillin and I had high levels of COVID anti-bodies in my blood. I was told point blank that they
would not issue an exemption as their careers as doctors may be in jeopardy as a result.

Clearly die governing bodies overseeing doctors and the Minister for Health and Health Department
are all complicit in Fraud and using coercion(extortion)

My Opinionated Directive:
Any government or authority trying to undermine the fundamental rights (in this case related to
personal health) from its people needs to be removed from governance (if necessary by force).
Coercion or extortion is a crime, and anyone involved in any coercion need to be held accountable
and punished. Adverse impacts on people as a result of poor decision making needs to be identified
as damages to be made good.
