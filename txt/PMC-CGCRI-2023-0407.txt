I think the Federal and State Government response to the COVID pandemic was an
example of Government overreach based on hubris and the enjoyment of power.

At the start, data available to the Government was apparently limited. The Government
correctly played it safe. However it quickly became clear the main danger was to older
people in poor health. For the rest of the public it was a case of severe flu. Death rates
were not catastrophic.
The government should have relaxed its lockdown policies at that point.

The subsequent Government response was authoritarian.

The restriction on freedom of choice and speech for citizens including health
professionals was unnecessary, undemocratic and probably counterproductive.

The mandates on hastily developed and poorly tested vaccines was dangerous, antiÂ­
democratic and possibly even corrupt.

A full Royal Commission is needed to try and understand what happened and why during
this period.
