Submission for Covid Response Inquiry                           12/3/2024

I would just like it noted that while I do not object to vaccinations as such, having had
all childhood vaccinations for myself and my children, I did strongly object to being
'forced' into vaccinations that had not been through the normal procedures of testing
for side effects.

The time constraint of testing these vaccines did not allow for the long term testing of
side effects on such things as the fertility of vaccinated children, in later life when
they want to have a family.
I found it undemocratic to be ostracised in my community for not being vaccinated,
when, as I have said, the vaccines had not had the proper amount of time to be fully
tested.

Then, it became necessary to have another vaccine and yet another and another.
That is not the definition of a vaccine.
To date I have not been vaccinated and have not had Covid.

I did strongly support the government in its lock down procedures. However, there
needs to be a line drawn between what is carried out for our safety and what
resembles signs of overt control as we are a democratic country.
