Royal Commission Necessary to Address Australia's Covid 19 Response



We need a Royal Commission for a proper investigation into;             vaccine procurement and^^M
           mask mandates; lock downs; vaccine mandates. We had a plan for our next pandemic. The
moment Covid 19 was identified as a pandemic, it seems we panicked and copied the approach used
in Communist China.

Other topics include th                      and^Hn ^e media regarding the ability of vaccines
to block transmission,^â– about the effectiveness and safety of useful proven treatments (HCQ and
Ivermectin) and prevention of prescription of HCQ and Ivermectin.

Further issues needing investigation are ongoing minimization of the significance and prevalence of
vaccine injuries;                                      the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship
and                doctors, and the poor treatment of victims.

There is also the issue of significantly high all cause deaths in 2022 and only recently falling toward
previous values. All cause deaths did not rise during the Covid Pandemic. Why did they rise in the
following years?

Unless there is a Royal Commission covering the above topics, we will be unprepared for the
inevitable next pandemic.
