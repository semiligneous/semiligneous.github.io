        Trickle-Down Apathy: A Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

I am an Australiai^^^^^^ who suffers from                                 As far as I know, I
have not had a COVID infection. Like many Australians, I do not have to look far to find the
vulnerable people in my life: my father-in-law is a^^^^^^^^^who suffers from^^^^
   I my brother is disabled, and his primary carer is our widowed mother in^^^^ I have
friends who have noted that, since their COVID infections, the duration of their illnesses (and
time taken off work) has increased, and that they are more sensitive to allergens than they
were previously. I have friends with children who are too young to qualify for vaccines and
boosters. My nephew has had two infections since 2022 - he is onlyH||||||^^

SARS-CoV-2 is an airborne virus. COVID transmission occurs not just through respiratory
droplets, as predominantly reported in the pandemic’s early years, but through aerosols that
can linger in the air for hours. The virus can be transmitted by presymptomatic and
asymptomatic individuals. COVID has the potential to cause long-term health problems; it is
capable of harming multiple organs and provoking cognitive and immune dysfunction. Well­
fitting respirators, clean air, frequent and accessible testing, up-to-date vaccinations, and
antiviral medication are all important tools in reducing transmission and long-term illness.

Everybody is at risk of poor health outcomes from COVID, and everybody stands to benefit
from CO VID education and mitigations - yet the effort to limit the spread of CO VID is
disproportionately shouldered by only a few in the community. I was grateful for the Federal
Government’s reasonably strong initial response to the pandemic, but I have been
disappointed with the erosion of public health measures over 2022 and 2023. Orders to
isolate while COVID-positive were withdrawn; wearing a mask in healthcare settings and
public transport became optional; PCR testing sites closed down; updates on COVID case
numbers (and the requirement to report them) faded away; and the cost of Paxlovid remains
prohibitive (upwards of $1,000). Furthermore, the failure to supress the widespread
transmission of CO VID means that its constant mutations outpace the development of
effective sterilising vaccines, locking Australians in a never-ending cycle of sickness and
clinically vulnerable Australians in a never-ending cycle of loneliness and isolation.

The government’s weakened approach to eradicating CO VID has enabled a broader apathy in
the Australian community. The burden of reminding friends and family to self-check on RATs
before social gatherings typically falls to my husband and me. Enquiries that I and others
have made about COVID mitigations to healthcare providers, blood donation centres,
conference committees, and festival coordinators - organisations for whom safeguarding the
health and wellbeing of attendees would be in their financial, legal, and ethical interest - are
too frequently shrugged off with empty responses: we are complying with all government
guidelines. In November this year, I was very often the only person at the supermarket
wearing a mask, despite the growing prevalence of COVID in my city (as indicated by
wast w< er su       if nee). I have heard distressing stories - through friends and through my
COVID awareness groups - of mask-wearers facing harassment and hostility from
employers, spouses, and complete strangers. Advocating for my health has always been a
daunting and effortful task: losing the support of strong messaging from the Federal
Government has made this task even more difficult.

Crucially, this apathy towards COVID inculcated by the government paves the way for a
deficient response to future pandemics. I therefore believe that the Federal Government’s
preparedness for future pandemics rests on strengthening its efforts to address the pandemic
occurring right now. The Federal Government might achieve this by:

    •   Developing a communication strategy to candidly inform the public about COVID -
        specifically that it is an airborne disease that can cause long-term health issues, and
        that a multi-layered approach (more than vaccines - masks, testing, clean air, broader
        access to antivirals) is necessary to reduce transmission.
    •   Mandating well-fitting respirators in healthcare settings, in airports, on commercial
        flights and on public transport. In my experience, these are places where the benefits
        of universal mask-wearing are very easily apparent, and mandates in these settings
        may increase the social acceptability of encouraging mask-wearing in other settings.
    •   Supporting the improvement of ventilation and air quality control in shared indoor
        spaces, particularly spaces where it may be onerous to expect continuous universal
        masking (e.g. primary schools, aged care homes, disability care homes, childcare
        centres).
    •   Encouraging the participation of organisations in creating a safer environment for
        vulnerable people - for example, a designated ‘mask day’ in major supermarkets
        and/or shopping centres, when it is the social expectation for staff and customers to
        wear a mask during operating hours on that day of the week. This might help
        normalise and de-stigmatise mask-wearing.
    •       Incentivising staying home from work while sick by providing financial support.
    •       Improving affordability of and access to PCR tests, RATs, and antiviral medication.
