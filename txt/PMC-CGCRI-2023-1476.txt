13 December 2023

Dear Ms Kruk,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide a submission to the Covid-19 Response Inquiry, which we would like
to do in relation to the impacts of the pandemic on people who experience eating disorders and their loved
ones and the broader health supports required by them during this type of extraordinary event.

About InsideOut Institute
InsideOut Institute (101) is Australia's national institute for research, translation and clinical excellence in eating
disorders. 101 comprises a team of expert researchers, clinicians and public policy-makers committed to
ensuring every person with an eating disorder has access to the best possible care. 101 also leads the Australian
Eating Disorder Research and Translation Centre.

About Eating Disorders
Eating disorders are common serious mental illnesses that are potentially life threatening. Compared with the
general population and people with other mental illnesses, people with eating disorders are at higher risk of
suicide, death and poor quality of life12- Eating disorders have a negative impact on the individual's life
physically, emotionally, occupationally and socially, and 'carer burden can lead to adverse personal, family and
patient outcomes'3,4. They affect people of all genders, cultural backgrounds and socioeconomic status and
from across the age spectrum - with onset in children as young as 5 years old5 and most people developing the
illness during childhood/adolescence and young adulthood. The majority of people with eating disorders
experience co-occurring mental illness such as anxiety and depression.

Despite significant advocacy over recent years and the implementation of the Australian Government MBS
Review initiative to provide Eating Disorder specific item numbers supporting access to an evidence-based dose
of treatment, eating disorders are under-diagnosed and under-treated - with low levels of clinician knowledge
and confidence reported by GPs6 7 8 and limited screening and assessment occurring in primary care9. Only a
small proportion of people who do access care receive evidence-based treatment10. Delayed diagnosis and
intervention has significant impacts on outcomes and health care costs for the person, their loved ones and the
health care system11.

Eating Disorders and the Covid-19 Pandemic
-    Incidence of eating disorders increased globally during the Covid-19 pandemic12'13'14'15' International
     studies reported increased ED referrals/presentations to a range of settings (primary care, acute care,
     specialist care, inpatient care) when compared with pre-pandemic rates16 particularly, among children and
     adolescents17-18,19 and females20.
In Australia:
-    Eating disorder behaviours increased in people with existing illness; eating disorders re-emerged in those
     who had been in recovery prior to the pandemic; and new experiences of eating disorders were
     triggered21.
-    Emergency department presentations of children with eating disorders increased where presentations for
     other reasons decreased e.g. a 104% increase in Perth22
-    There were 'striking increases' in admissions of children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa and
     atypical anorexia nervosa to paediatric hospitals and eating disorder units - e.g. the Adolescent Medicine
     Eating Disorder Unit at Monash Children's Hospital found an increase of 125.70%23 and the Royal Children's
     Hospital demonstrated a 63% increase24.
-    Data in preparation for publication by our team demonstrates that in QLD, Victoria and NSW these trends
     in presentation rates preceded the pandemic: from 2012-2019 significantly increased rates across the
     whole health system in hospital, community and emergency departments were observed for eating
     disorder diagnoses year on year, and most markedly in younger people.

A range of reasons have been posited or reported as contributing to these significant shifts in eating disorder
presentations during the pandemic, particularly in relation to lockdown restrictions, for example:

-    Stress, anxiety, increased uncertainty and feelings of loss of control often relate to eating disorder
     pathology onset and deterioration25creating the ‘perfect storm' for people with eating disorders26 when
     these also occur as the result of a pandemic.
-    ‘worries about C0VID-19 infection, lockdown, concerns about lack of structure and social support, and
     concerns about accessing food consistent with one's recovery meal plan predicted increases in ED
     symptoms'27 - people experiencing food insecurity are known to be at higher risk for eating disorders and
     increased eating disorder behaviours, particularly binge eating type disorders28
-    for children and young people - school closures, online learning, limited peer, sport and recreational
     activities, disrupted school and social routines29; greater engagement with social media triggered weight
     and body checking behaviours, there was greater preoccupation with cooking recipes and more eating-
     related conflict with parents30
-    social isolation and loneliness31 was significantly associated with increased severity in all eating disorder
     symptoms except for over-exercise32
-    reduced treatment access and quality, in the context of increased anxiety and depression33
-    videoconferencing for work/study-related purposes is associated with performance anxiety, impaired
     engagement, and avoidance among individuals at-risk for EDs34

Recommendations for future pandemic response planning in relation to broader health supports for people
with eating disorders include:
1. That eating disorders be identified as a priority at-risk group in regard to policy, planning, service delivery
    and supports during a pandemic response, and as such, be deemed eligible for any temporary
    arrangement made, such as:
         a. bulk billing of telehealth with GPs, paediatricians, psychiatrist, psychologists and dietitians, as well
              as other mental health professionals who are eligible providers of treatment under the eating
              disorder care plan
         b. inclusion as a priority group listed for any Priority Assistance Programs such as in relation to food
              delivery and other programs delivering services or supports related to the condition
         c. provision of working from home arrangements for parents and carers of people with eating
              disorders who may be home through school or workplace closures
2. That GPs and other health professionals be provided with advice regarding predicted increases in eating
    disorder experiences alongside other health and mental health advice generated during a pandemic, so
    that attention to screening and assessment are heightened, and additional supports are put in place for
    people with eating disorders and their families. This capacity would be greatly enhanced if GPs and other
    health professionals received training in eating disorders as part of their health professional
    undergraduate education, and where they have access to professional development, tools and practice­
    based resources required to undertake screening, assessment and provide evidence-based treatment at
    point of care - such as can be provided through InsideOut Institute. For example, our GP Hub and Tools is a
    point of care resource for General Practitioners being rolled out in 2024 with funding by the Australian
    Government Leadership in Mental Health Program.
3. That information campaigns are explicit in informing people with eating disorders that they are at
    particular risk for experiencing an increase in their eating disorder symptoms and/or a decline in their
    mental health and outlining additional supports and services that are available35.
4. That national mental health telephone crisis providers (e.g. Lifeline, Kids Helpline) and PHN Intake
    Assessment and Referral (IAR) telephone support services are upskilled around eating disorders, to ensure
    the advice provided is aligned with best practice and most likely to produce a positive outcome for the
    person - directing them towards people and supports that might help. For example, InsideOut Institute
    delivers training and support through our eLearning portal, via webinar and face to face to headspace and
    head to health services nationally, and to PHN Intake Assessment and Referral (IAR) providers, around
    screening, assessment and evidence-based care for people with eating disorders.
5. That adaptive, flexible, support services are established and available to people with eating disorders and
    their families - accessible regardless of geographical areas6. This might include initiatives such as Hospital
    in the Home, and online components of care, such as provision of eating disorder groups and individual
    treatment, peer supports, single session interventions and digital eTherapy. For example, InsideOut's
                                                                                           Level 2, The Charles Perkins Centre, D17

     eClinic provides evidence-based digital therapies accessible for pure self-help and supported self-help for
     people with the most common eating disorders. Our eClinic will be rolled out nationally in 2024 with
     funding from the Australian Government Leadership in Mental Health Program.
6.   That mental health clinicians and educators are made aware of the need to provide increased monitoring
     of patients with eating disorders and provide additional support to people with eating disorders using
     videoconferencing who may experiencing additional concerns in relation to use of the medium for
     school/work/treatment37.
7.   That additional supports be put in place for families of people with eating disorders in regard to online
     meal supports, family supports and treatment, and peer mentoring, such as is provided by Eating
     Disorders Families Australia, Eating Disorders Victoria and Eating Disorders Queensland.

In summary, while the overall public health response in Australia was timely, consistent, and comprehensive,
people with eating disorders were disproportionately affected, including those with existing illness, those who
had previously achieved recovery, and those developing the illness for the first time. Research findings highlight
the importance of prioritising the mental health of those at risk of eating disorder, and of ensuring enhanced
care options and supports implemented for those with eating disorders during critical points in time during a
pandemic. Increased awareness, screening, assessment, and an increase in the available options for treatment
may well be needed to better manage the effects of the pandemic on people with eating disorders.
