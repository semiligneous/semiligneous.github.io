The Federal Government's Approach to the COVID-19 Pandemic - Response Inquiry Submission.

Introduction

My name is Elissa Smith, an individual, mother, full time employed, caring and loyal citizen of Australia. I
am representing only myself, and my family with this submission.

The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in unparalleled challenges globally, supposedly necessitating rapid
and decisive responses from governments. Australia, like other nations, implemented multifaceted
measures to curb the virus, with a pronounced emphasis on vaccination campaigns. However, concerns
surfaced regarding the federal government's approach and its potential impact on individual rights and the
sovereignty of citizens over their bodies. This response highlights the perceived destructive elements of
the government's strategy, particularly in light of current excess mortality rates, and scrutinises the
messaging surrounding COVID-19 and vaccinations.

Government Messaging and Individual Rights

One contentious aspect is the government's pandemic messaging, which critics argue may have been
excessively alarmist, portraying COVID-19 as an imminent and deadly threat, when in fact the statistics
from the outset were that those in the later stages of life were at increased risk only, and those with
specific comorbities. This narrative, some contend, might have contributed to the erosion of individual
rights, especially with respect to vaccination mandates. The right to maintain sovereignty over one's body
is fundamental to personal autonomy, especially in a democratic society such as Australia, and I would
posit that the government's messaging and position around vaccination ignored the data and
compromised individual decision-making regarding a person's own body.

Vaccination Policies and Experimental Nature

Critics also express concern about the rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines,
emphasising their experimental nature. The accelerated approval and promotion of these vaccines may
have unnecessarily prioritised public health objectives over individual rights. The government seemed to
ignore voices from a wide variety of sources, shutting down any opposition to the pro-vaccination
narrative which include valid concerns around the vaccination trials, unknown long-term effects, linkages
that some politicians have to â€˜big pharma', and the overall suitability to those within the population that
were at little of being impacted by Covid.

Comparative Analysis: COVID-19 vs. Vaccination Outcomes and Excess Mortality Rates

An essential facet of the debate revolves around the actual outcomes of COVID-19 compared to the
effects of vaccination, with a specific focus on excess mortality rates. Critics argue that the government's
emphasis on the severity of the virus may have overshadowed an objective assessment of the risks and
benefits associated with vaccination. Excess mortality is well above pre-pandemic levels within Australia,
we now have a number of young adults experiencing myo-carditis and other vaccine related effects,
which were not even part of the Australian vernacular prior to 2020. Those countries that did not engage
in staunch vaccine programs, don't seem to have the same excess-mortality rates which demonstrate that
these rates are better explained by the use of vaccine rather than virus.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the federal government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia has prompted
discussions on the delicate equilibrium between public health imperatives and individual rights. The
perceived destructiveness of the government's approach, especially concerning vaccination policies, is
further examined in the context of excess mortality rates, shedding light on the nuanced relationship
between public health measures and individual rights.
