Covid Response Submission

I wish the enquiry to consider the following issues.

    1.   Doctors were not allowed to use all their knowledge to treat covid. This should have been
         encouraged even before vaccines became available. Much knowledge was available
         internationally by a wide range of doctors who were successfully treating covid, but were
         ignored by our medical authorities.
    2.   Medications available overseas and already proven safe were banned in our country. Any
         avenue should have been used to treat covid based on medical experience from all sources.
         Pharmaceutical companies seem to override the experience of on the ground doctors.
    3.   Our citizens should have been notified of preventive measures, many of which were already
         known before vaccines were released. Under federal jurisdiction, our medical authorities did
         not consider the experience of our Australian doctors and specialists. Early in the peace,
         Australia showed signs of leading the way, but these early gains were overridden and
         ignored.
    4.   The Federal Government or its agencies should never inhibit our medical staff from providing
         the best care for their patients - based on their experience and conscience.
    5.   The Federal Government or its agencies should never force people to undergo medical
         procedures and any medical procedures should always be accompanied by informed
         consent.
    6.   Staff in the Federal Government and its agencies must ensure they undertake all
         investigations necessary and then be individually responsible for the decisions they make -
         along with the policies and directions to which they make a contribution.

Thanks for your consideration,
