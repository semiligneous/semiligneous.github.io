I am writing in regard to the Federal Government's enquiry into the response to the Covid pandemic.

Mandatory vaccination was detrimental to personal health and confidence in both the government
and the medical profession. It caused unnecessary anxiety, health problems and the polarizing of the
population.

I personally experienced all these consequences and know of many others in the same predicament.
I accepted vaccination from fear of discrimination to the unvaccinated and to keep my job.

This discrimination was real. Many people were denied health care, social interactions, and jobs
because they were unvaccinated. The fear perpetrated regarding the 'anti-vax's' showed how quickly
a group in society can be demonized on completely irrational criteria. This was alarming to see.

People felt compelled to undertake an action they were opposed to, from a scientific, moral and
social perspective.

As a result of adverse reactions to the vaccine, misinformation about the effectiveness of the vaccine
to stop transmission of the virus, and the excessive policing of masks and regulations etc. people
have become very skeptical and wary of the medical profession, the media propaganda machine and
politicians.

I personally required medical attention because of the second vaccine and came across many others
in a similar position.

Ignoring the National Pandemic plans already in place since the Abbot lead Liberal government, the
failure to approve nasal swabs before the vaccine was available, pressure on doctors and other
professionals who had reservations about the vaccine, etc all indicated to even the most
disinterested lay person a level of manipulation of the public, unprecedented in our history and one
which should never happen again.
