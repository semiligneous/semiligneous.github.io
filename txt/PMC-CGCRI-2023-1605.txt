COVID-19 Response Inquiry:                    15 December, 2023

The purpose of this inquiry is to learn and thus improve Australia's preparedness for future pandemics

Given the timing of this inquiry, it is evident that the measures put in place by the Federal Government, and the State
Governments did a) not work; and b) caused more harm than good.

However, the politicians (and bureaucrats in power) still refuse to acknowledge any adverse reactions in a range of
sectors including health, financial, business, education - and the list goes on. This is shown by the paltry excuse that
the scope of this 'inquiry' covers (or does not).



Term of reference: Key health response measures (COVID-19 vaccinations and public health messaging).

Health

    •       This was a respiratory disease with a very low fatality rate yet hysterically pushed
    •    Any doctor, nurse, or health professional who expressed scepticism in the protocols pushed onto the public
         were censored and threatened (which is continuing onto this day)
    •    Mask wearing - which is known to have negative health effects without proper control. Studies from many
         decades were totally ignored for 'supposed safety'

Covid Gene Vaccines

    •    Hurriedly pushed through and not tested by the TGA (solely relying upon the manufacturer). Please check who
         funds the TGA (would that be the pharmaceutical companies?)
    •       Lack of reporting of those who have been experiencing side effects, injury, or death (who are still being ignored
         and shunned)
    •    Mandating of an experimental drug causing hardship for many people - many losing their livelihoods because
         they chose not to participate in a drug trial
    •       Total disregard for people's bodily autonomy and health situations
    •    The amount of money that was spent on the initial rollout of these drugs (most of them being binned because
         they couldn't be used in time) - now being reflected on the state of the economy

Lockdowns

    •       Resulting in an escalation of mental health issues and suicide rates which is also being ignored



I would like to request why several years of scientific evidence was disregarded and new 'science' was quoted which
had no relevance except to push the 'CoVid' agenda.

Trust has totally eroded in all Australian institutes, especially as more evidence comes to light. I strongly suggest if you
want to earn that trust back, this Government do the right thing and hold a proper Royal Commission.
