Call for submissions and evidence to the
COVID-19 Response Inquiry
Greetings, I am a long time West Australian citizen with a Bachelor of
Science in Horticulture.



According to the "Western Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance -
Annual Report 2021" published by the West Australian Department
of Health, the average number of adverse effects following
vaccination in 2017-2020 was 276. In 2021 the number of adverse
effects following vaccination was 10,726. This is an increase of 38.86
times. This occurred with only a 2.78 times increase in the number of
vaccines administered in 2021 compared to 2020.

These are shocking statistics which shows the risks of taking a covid
vaccine were extremely high. The total Adverse Effects rate Following
a COVID-19 vaccine was 264.1 per 100,000 doses in WA.



The government also engaged in vaccine information censorship. The
Australian newspaper reported on May 22, 2023 in an article titled
"Canberra Silenced posts on Covid" that the federal government
intervened at least 4213 times to restrict or censor posts about the
Covid-19pandemic on digital platforms.


This is a national shame and should never be repeated. It shows
government overreach, treating Australians as stupid and
government compliance with large pharmaceutical companies
influence.
