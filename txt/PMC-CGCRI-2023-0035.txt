Health and non health responses

Responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the role of the state and territory governments

On our arrival at the Perth Airport our Negative Covid Test results were dismissed as unimportant.

Our printed G2G pass stating that our quarantine address was our home address was dismissed.

We were forced into hotel quarantine for 14 days.

We had to have 2 Covid tests in that period and were denied the results. We were negative.

The room was unclean. We had no opening windows or access to fresh air. We had no change of
linen for 14 days.

Family supplied us with food.

We were treated as criminals and demonised.

We have emotional damage, sleep problems, a lack of trust and permanent mental anguish.

Suggested future Government responses based upon our experience:-

      •   Ensure that all Australian citizens who are overseas and wish to return home are able to do
          so rather than blocking this by way of cancelled flights, restricted flights and costly flights.
      •   Acknowledge that returning Australian citizens who can prove their current health situation
          are acknowledged, by having trained medical staff at the airport.
      •       Quarantine should only be for those citizens who are infected and or contagious.
      •   Quarantine facilities must be fit for purpose, clean rooms, clean linen access to fresh air and
          quality food.
      •       Quarantine services are to be a Commonwealth responsibility and all costs covered by them.
