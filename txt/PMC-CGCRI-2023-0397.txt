Submission to Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry
Submitted by a        resident on 11th December, 2023.

I am writing to request a proper and thorough investigation into:
    •      Secret contracts for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines & boosters.
    • Official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of the covid vaccines to
      block transmission and the downplaying of vaccine side effects and potential for serious
      harm including myocarditis.
    • Silencing of doctors and other health professionals and the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in
      this.
    • Vaccine mandates including ‘no jab, no job’ when clearly the unvaccinated were no more
      likely to pass the Covid-19 virus on to others than their vaccinated co-workers were.
    • Lockdowns, curfews and travel restrictions including the 5 km limit, which had flow-on
      effects that created undue personal suffering and diminished mental health, financial
      hardship, loss of livelihood, closure of businesses, breakdown of community networks, and
      much more, without any strong evidence that these measures were justified and useful.

As well as the Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry, Australians deserve a
Royal Commission into the Covid-19 Response, as the next step after completion of the
Commonwealth Government Inquiry.
