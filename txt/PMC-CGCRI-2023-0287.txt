Urgent Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding the handling of the COVID-19
crisis by the Australian government. As an Australian citizen, mother, and grandmother who has
diligently contributed to society through years of hard work and tax payments, I find it imperative to
voice my grievances and demand a thorough investigation into the government's actions during this
challenging period.



The Australian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching and devastating
consequences. Businesses have been decimated, families torn apart, and the most vulnerable members
of our society, such as my dear mother, were left to pass away in isolation, deprived of the comfort of
their loved ones. The economic fallout, including the reckless printing of vast amounts of money for the
monetary business support fund, has only added to the turmoil.



It is disheartening to observe the government blindly adhering to the directives of the World Health
Organization (WHO) without conducting its own investigations. The health system was left in the hands
of bureaucrats, while doctors and scientists were muzzled, and illegal mandates were enforced.
Australians lost their jobs simply for exercising their fundamental human rights and choosing not to
undergo an experimental medical procedure.



The government's promotion of the so-called "safe and effective" vaccine has proven to be a facade.
Contrary to assurances, many vaccinated individuals, including my children and grandchildren, have
contracted COVID-19 multiple times, and a distressing number of citizens have suffered severe and
horrific side effects, leading to untimely deaths for many. The alarming 16% excess death rate in Australia
cannot be ignored, and the government's apparent apathy towards all-cause mortality raises serious
questions about its commitment to the well-being of its citizens. We are all fearful of how this medical
procedure will affect our health in the future.



The Australian public is no longer willing to accept the lies and propaganda disseminated by the
government and health officials. The demand for a royal commission is not merely a request; it is a
resounding call from the people who have witnessed the mismanagement and disregard for public
welfare. An inquiry conducted without proper notice or transparency is insufficient to address the
magnitude of the grievances we, as Australians, harbor.



Therefore, I, along with countless others, implore the Australian government to initiate a Royal
Commission to thoroughly investigate its actions during the COVID-19 crisis. We demand transparency,
accountability, and justice for the lives disrupted and lost during this tumultuous period.
