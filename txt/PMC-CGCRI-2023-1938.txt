Australian Citizen




Re: Call for submissions and evidence to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry


The Federal Government failed to protect Australian citizens from discrimination by voting down
the COVID-19 Vaccination Status Bill 2022, and the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2023.
The government’s failure to protect its citizens from workplace discrimination via vaccine
mandates caused undue stress, created civil and familial unrest, significant loss of income and
forced some Australians into unemployment for months or years.
Australian citizens have the right to exercise bodily autonomy, regardless of the perceived risk
or circumstance, and even in a pandemic. For many people, the consequences of exercising
bodily autonomy resulted in job losses, and restrictions of freedom of movement. These
outcomes were unacceptable.
The Federal Government’s response to COVID-19 failed the Australian population, by removal
of freedom of choice, and bodily autonomy.
A Royal Commission, or larger public enquiry, should be initiated to thoroughly
investigate the Federal Government and its draconian, heavy handed, and undemocratic
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
