To Whom It May Concern,

I am a woman living in NSW who was performing the job of COVID warden for our church during the
COVID pandemic. I acknowledge that none of us had experienced something like this before and that
on the whole, although the restrictions we had to abide by were difficult, they were able to be
adhered to in the rural setting I find myself living and working in. I personally was not inconvenienced
to the same extent as some during 2020 - 2021.

However, I am writing to you about the COVID - 19 response by the government to divide our society
into 2 sections - that is the vaccinated and the non- vaccinated. I found this very divisive and it led to
a delay in the opening up process as our church either had to not allow some people to attend or to
stick to the former rules when new ones were introduced as our state lifted some restrictions. This
was more frustrating as we were drawing our line in the sand based on vaccination's which were not
preventing us from getting COVID in the first place and not curers.

As COVID warden, I spent a great deal of time reading the documents that outlined the restrictions
as they were released and found it difficult as I had to read through the whole document carefully to
find the changes in restrictions and to re-read it carefully - as I am not a lawyer.




Thank you for the time to read this
