COVID 19 Inquiry Submission
By Julia Williams^^^^^|

The short duration of time to get submissions in is^^^^|and unprofessional.

I request a proper Royal Commission for a proper investigation into^^^^|vaccine
procurement and                     mask mandates; lock downs; vaccine mandates,
                                  the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
transmission, vaccine injuries; media censorship silencing of doctors, the role of
AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship anc^^^^^Hof doctors, and the poor treatment
of victims of the unsafe COVID ‘vaccinations’.

Broader Health & Social Supports
The mandates which stopped ‘unvaccinated’ people flying and travelling interstate
were against Australian Freedom. I was born here and if I choose move within the
Country between States then I have the right to do that, regardless of what my
medical history is.

Wearing a mask was difficult to breath in.

 The^^^^^^^H by the media and Government, the gagging of Health
 Professionals that lead to the social assassination of the ‘unvaccinated’ or anyone
 who said anything against the safety of the COVID vaccinations was one of the most
^^^^■experiences in my 40 odd years of life. People saying that ‘unvaccinated’
 should be refused medical treatment and deserved to die was unfathomable.

The Government failing to support Dr               protein vaccination and throwing
money behind the new mRna vaccines is a failure on so many levels. Support
Australian Business and Talent. If this vaccination was available I would have
gotten it. But it has been and continues to be, blocked at every opportunity by the
biased entity in charge of approving medicines.

Financial Support For Individuals
I lost my job because I refused the Covid “vaccination”. Even though I worked in a
centre with disabled people, I had no direct contact with them. The Government
‘recommendation’ didn’t apply to me as the Bookkeeper. The company’s decision to
make it policy that everyone was to have the recommended COVID ‘vaccinations’
was discrimination and unacceptable. I lost most of my income because I didn’t
want to be a lab rat.

Key Health Response Measures
The lockdowns and restrictions of movement, even within Australia meant I couldn’t
visit family interstate and they couldn’t come to me. Telling me what I can and can’t
do is an infringement on my freedom as an Australian.

The people that should have been restricted was foreigners trying to enter our
country. People returning from overseas should have been quarantined.

I apologise if this is too rushed, but with such a tight deadline, you are making this
process                                       The COVID debacle makes me ashamed
to be an Australian.
