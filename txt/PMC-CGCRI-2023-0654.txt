Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry
The RoyalFlying Doctor Service (RFDS) hasbeen serving rural and remote areas since 1928. The RFDS operates
an extensive network of aeromedical emergency services, primary healthcare clinics, telehealth services, dental
and mentalhealth services, immunisations, and non-emergency patient transport. The RFDS plays a crucial role
in bridging the healthcare gap for people living in isolated communities with challenging landscapes and hash
climates. The RFDS is trusted for its expertise in aeromedical retrievals and conducted over 9,000 COVID-19
retrievals during the pandemic (see attachment 1, which details our early aeromedicalresponse). The RFDS also
actively engages with communities, collaborates with government agencies and industry partners, and conducts
research to improve health outcomes for rural and remote Australians. It is funded by State, Territory, and
Commonwealth governments in addition to relying on donations, bequests, and corporate partnerships to support
its operations and invest in infra structure. Being a trusted national icon has enabled the RFDS to respond quickly
during times of crisis.

Working closely with its partners, the RFDS played a crucial role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in
mral and remote areas of Australia. The RFDS established a unique SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program to deliver
vaccines to vulnerable populations in these areas. We conducted extensive aeromedical retrievals and road
transports for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, ensuring that patients could receive the necessaiy
care and treatment (see attachment 2, which details our COVID-19 medication treatment protocol). The RFDS
also partnered with communities and engaged in cultural awareness trainingto build and maintain trust and address
vaccine hesitancy, particularly in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Through our vaccination
clinics, the RFDS administered over 90,000 vaccines to rural and remote populations (see attachment 3, which
details some of our vaccination activity). Additionally, the RFDS conducted surge planning and modelling to
ensure we could meetthedemand forCOVID-19-related services, including the transportation ofpatients and the
provision of primary healthcare (see attachment 4 and 5).

The RFDS COVID-19 response was governed by an Alliance Governance Framework. This framework was
designed to improve patient care in a systematic and accountable manner while reducing overall costs by
encouraging providers to pool funds and share resources. Under this framework, all organisations involved in the
response, including the RFDS and the Commonwealth Government, were equal partners, sharing the risks and
responsibilities.

Overall, the RFDS COVID-19 response demonstrated ourcommitmentto delivering healthcare services to rural
and remote communities during the pandemic. We utilised our existing community trust and relationships and
organisationalinfrastructureto provide vaccinations, conduct retrievals, andaddressthe unique challenges posed
by COVID-19 in mral and remote areas. The RFDS's efforts were supported by funding from the Commonwealth
Govemmentof Australia, with a flexible governance and reporting structure allowing us to effectively respond to
the needs of communities. Our response serves as an example of the importance of tailored and community-
informed healthcare delivery in remote areas during a pandemic.

The RFDS implemented several key COVID-19 response measures. Some of these measures included:
    1. Vaccination clinics: We conducted extensive workforce modelling to determine areas requiring
       services based on potential infection, which in turn enabled us to established vaccination clinics in
       mral and remote areas to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to vulnerable populations. Without our
       public health and research capabilities, we would not have been able to conduct clinics across
       Australia, immunising over 90,000 patients in addition to providing over 100,000 doses to other service
       providers (maintaining cold-chain and conducting clinical education).
    2. Aeromedical and road retrievals: The RFDS conducted aeromedical retrievals forCOVID-19 patients,
       transporting them to hospitals for isolation and care. We conducted over 9,000 COVID-19 retrievals
       by road and air ambulance.
    3. Mobile General Practitioner clinic services: The RFDS provided mobile general practitioner clinic
       services to remote communities, ensuring access to primary healthcare services during the pandemic.
    4. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) delivery: The RFDS delivered personal protective equipment to
       healthcare providers and communities in need throughout the country.

    5.   Stakeholder engagement: The RFDS engaged with community leaders, representatives, and Indigenous
         communities to understand their needs, build trust, and provide culturally appropriate healthcare
         services.

The key aspects that contributed to the success of the RFDS in its COVID-19 response were as follows:
    1. Existing infrastructure and relationships: The RFDS had existing relationships with remote communities
        through aeromedical retrieval and mobile primary healthcare services, which positioned us well to
        provide vaccination clinics to vulnerable populations in remote areas.
    2. Partnership with the Australian Government: The RFDS partnered with the Austrahan Federal
        Government in "Operation COVID Shield" and was engaged to conduct vaccinations in mral and remote
        Australia. This partnership provided essential fundingand support forthe RFDS COVID-19 response.
    3. Stakeholder engagement and community consultation: We engaged with community leaders, mayors,
        councils, anddisastermanagement groups to identify the needs of different communities. We conducted
        community events, information sessions, and yarning sessions with Indigenous communities to build
        relationships and trust. This approach empowered communities to request vaccine assistance services.
    4. Tailored response based on community needs: We adapted ourvaccination clinics based on community
        expectations and needs. We provided culturally appropriate and safe health education to combat vaccine
        hesitancy and misinformation, particularly in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
    5. Surge workforce models: We recognised the undersupply of health workforce in rural Austraha and
        incorporated surge workforce models into our response planning. This allowed us to deploy additional
        clinicians and resources to meet the demand for vaccinations in remote areas.
    6. ReHable supply chains and resource provision: We spent time estabhshing reHable supply chains for
        vaccines, vaccine consumables, and personal protective equipment in geographically isolated
        environments. We ensured early provision of essential resources to mral communities.
    7. Funding and support: The RFDS COVID-19 response was funded and supported by the Commonwealth
        Government of Austraha. This funding enabled us to respond quickly and effectively to the pandemic
        and protect mral and remote communities.

These aspects, including existing infrastmcture (including robust RFDS data and reporting), partnerships,
stakeholder engagement, tailored response, surge workforce models, reHable supply chains, and funding support,
contributed to the success of the RFDS in our COVID-19 response.

The key aspects that need national improvements for future pandemic responses include:
    1. Nationally agreed clinical pre-deployment standards, outhning estabhshed community consultation plans
        outlining the areas ‘needs assessment’ reflecting clinical case-mix and workforce provision. This will
        ensure that community needs are addressed and there is no duphcation of efforts, while maintaining
        community tmst and support throughout the response.
    2. Comprehensive Austrahan data a vailability: There is aneed forreadily available comprehensive data to
        guide decision-making during a pandemic response. This includes optimal disease surveillance and
        response stmctures, as well as advanced pathogen genomics and novel vaccine technology for effective
        disease surveillance.
    3. Timely and clear communication: Timely, clear, and open communication is essential to maintain
        population cooperation and tmst during a pandemic response. Decision-making should be evidence-
        informed and as consultative as possible.
    4. Strengthened preparedness plans: Existing preparedness plans were found to be insufficient during the
        COVID-19 pandemic, and major system weaknesses were exposed, particularly in the residential aged-
        care sector. Regular revision and proactive simulation of preparedness plans should be prioritised to
        address future pandemics.
    5. Infection prevention and control measures: Effective infection prevention and control measures are
        crucial to keep healthcare workers safe and limit population transmission during a pandemic response.
    6. Consideration of children and young people: The interests of children and young people should be
        adequately represented in decision-making processes during a pandemic response.
    7. Workforce development and research investment: Nationalpandemic responses highlighted the need for
        ongoing investment in workforce development and research to strengthen pandemic response
        capabilities.
    8. Global sohdarity and regional engagement: Stronger global sohdarity and regional engagement are
        necessary to effectively manage an evolving global health threat and prevent and prepare for future
        challenges.
    9. Whole-of-Govemment planning and supply chain considerations: Critical workforce and supply chain
        interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic emphasised the importance of whole-of-govemment

         (explicitly State and Territory governments) planning and consideration of national self-sufficiency in
         times of a global crisis. We require better cross-border protocols during times of social isolation
         measures, to enable national service providers (such as the RFDS) with consistent operating procedures,
         such as clinical isolation measures and infection testing/ screening.
     10. Community partnerships and multidirectional communication: Proactive community partnerships and
         multidirectional communication should be prioritised to enhance pandemic preparedness and response.
     11. Access to affordable treatments and vaccines: Access to affordable treatments and vaccines for all should
         be a guiding principle for pandemic preparedness and response.

These improvements are based on the lessons learned from the RFDS COVID-19 response and an analysis of the
pandemic's impact on healthcare services in mral and remote areas of Australia.

Based on our RFDS response; some key pohcy strategies that can be implemented to improve Austraha's response
to future pandemics:
     1. Strengthening mral and remote healthcare provision: Implement policies to address the underlying
         problems with healthcare access in mral and remote areas, such as limited access to essential services
         like general practitioners and nursing clinics. This can be achieved by ensuring a robust healthcare
         workforce in these communities, improving health literacy, and building tmst within health services.
     2. Systemising data entry and reporting: Develop a standardised approach to data entry and reporting across
         Australian states and territories to avoid inconsistencies and delays. This will enable targeted response
         measures based on specific areas and populations, improving the effectiveness of pandemic response
          efforts.
     3. Enhancing governance and coordination: Improve the governance and coordination of pandemic
         response efforts by strengthening the role of the Commonwealth Government, clarifying the
         responsibilities of state and territory governments, and enhancingnational governance mechanisms. We
         recommend a "nationalcompacton mraland remote health", to serve as an inter-govemmentalagreement
         between the Commonwealth, states and territories, thus demonstrating commitment to improving the
         health outcomes of those Hving in mral and remote Australia.
     4. Ensuring consistent population vaccination data and transmission rates: Establish mechanisms to
          systemise data collection and reporting on population vaccination rates and transmission rates. This will
          enable more effective planning and response measures based on real-time data, ensuring a rapid and
         targeted response to outbreaks.
     5. Strengthening mental health support: Develop policies and interventions aimed at supporting mental
         health during pandemics, particularly in mral and remote communities. This can include increasing
         access to mentalhealth care, providing support for mental health professionals, and addressingthe social
         isolation and loneliness experienced in these communities.
     6. Learning from global experiences: Leam from the experiences and lessons of other countries in
         responding to pandemics. This can involve studying global best practices, reviewing international
         policies, and incorporating successful strategies into Austraha's pandemic response measures.

The RFDS is pleased to make this submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry, and we would welcome the
opportunity to give evidence in person.
