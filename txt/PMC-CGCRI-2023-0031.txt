COVID 19 ISSUES
I was convinced that with the government “forcing”
everyone to have the vaccinations that the Australian
medical profession would have done the due diligence
& the vaccines would be safe so I went ahead & had
them as soon as they became available.

 July 2021 I started loosing muscle strength. I initially
put it down to “self isolation” & COVID lockdown
but now (in hindsight) I believe it was related to the
AstraZeneca vaccinations. Had I recognised this I
wouldn’t have had the Pfizer Booster.

Pfizer COVID Booster.
January 2022 I was loosing strength. I have a mine
                  & was previously able to hold a
jackhammer above my head. By late January 2022 I
couldn’t even open a bottle of water. My wife had to
open bottles for me or I had to hold the lid between
my teeth & twist the bottle. I developed Ear Aches,
 Shoulder Pain & my muscle strength continued to
diminish. My doctor sent me to several specialists.
I believe it was all caused by the Vaccinations &
Pfizer Booster.
