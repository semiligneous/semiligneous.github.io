RESPONSE TO THE COVID INQUIRY
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the inquiry into the Commonwealth Government's response to the COVID-19
pandemic.
I am a lawyer by profession, a small business owner, and a mother of two, pre-school aged children. I am also an engaged
citizen who closely followed the development of covid policy, particularly the interactions of the federal system, the
separation of powers, and ministerial responsibility as regards the approval, procurement, and provision of COVID-19
vaccines.
My submission is particularly concerned with the failure of the Government, its agents and assigns, to make a covid vaccine
available to under 5-year-olds, which failure is ongoing as at the time of writing.

HISTORY OF PAEDIATRIC COVID VACCINATION
A covid vaccine for children aged 6 months to 5 years old was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on 17
June 2022.1
Vaccination for the 5-11 years' cohort had been approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration ("TGA") and
recommended by ATAGI in December 2021, and the rollout began in Australia on 10 January 2022, albeit with significant
supply delays.
As the parent of two children under the age of 5, the additional 6-month wait for the vaccine for their age group to be
approved seemed interminable. The relief when the vaccine was finally approved in the US was immense - there was hope
that once the corresponding approvals were processed in Australia, we would finally be able to protect our children.
Both Moderna & Pfizer-BioNTech subsequently sought emergency approval in Australia, with TGA approving Moderna
Spikevax for children aged 6 months-6 years on 19 July 2022. Pfizer Comirnaty for children aged 6 months - 5 years was
subsequently approved on 29 September 2022.
On 3 August 2022,                                     is that only children with severe immunocompromise, disability, and
those who have complex and/or multiple health conditions which increase the risk of severe COVID-19 were to be vaccinated.
The rollout to those children commenced on 5 September 2022.
In late 2023, most Australian children under 5 years of age are still unable to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
This submission contends that these children have been, and continue to be, overlooked, neglected, discriminated against,
and exposed to undue and unnecessary risk of harm, including death.

ATAGI'S RECOMMENDATIONS
In examining ATAGI's 3 August 2022 recommendations regarding the 6 months - 5 year age group, the stated rationale can
be summarised as essentially that 'these children have a very low likelihood of severe illness from COVID-19', however, their
reasoning is open to scrutiny.
ATAGI's summary of recommendations included the following statements:
1. The very low risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g.,
                                                                                    Monthly Rates of COVID-19-Associated Hospitalizations by Age Group, 2021-22
   hospitalisation due to COVID-19) in healthy children
   aged 6 months to <5 years. This age group is one of
   the least likely age groups to reguire hospitalisation
   due to COVID-19.
   The evidence shows that children under 5 years of
   age were most likely to require hospitalisation.              S
                                                                 s

   hospitalisation for 0-4 well above other age groups
   for whom vaccination was permitted (5-17 years)2.
   21,176 Australian children (aged 0-4) were
   hospitalised with a covid diagnosis in 2021-22,
   which number represents 1.4% of that population
   cohort (compared to 0.85% of the population aged
   5-14)3.                                                                                             January

   PIMS-TS is only one, and a relatively rare, complication of COIVD-19.4 It is submitted that using PIMS cases as the measure
   of the severity of Covid-19 in children would underestimate the severity/impact on children. One must wonder whether the
   consideration that a rare complication is slightly rarer in a certain age group, is good reason to deny access to vaccines to an
   entire cohort. Further, vaccine effectiveness at reducing MIS-C/PIMS-TS has been demonstrated to be in the order of 91%5 -
   94%6. The rate of vaccine-induced PIMS-TS is far lower than the rate occurring after infection with COVID-19.7 How much
   unnecessary suffering could have been prevented by the timely and widespread vaccination of children of all age groups?
3. Up to one in four children in this age group had a fever following vaccination with Moderna vaccine, with higher rates seen in
   those with a history of previous COVID-19.
   Whilst fever in small children is a concerning occurrence, the Commonwealth's own immunisation handbook states that up
   to 15% of young children receiving MMR vaccine may develop a high fever. Indeed, every single vaccination currently listed
   on the childhood immunisation schedule has fever listed as a side effect and parents are conditioned to be cognisant of the
   risk of fever after vaccination. Can it be true that a slight increase in the rate of the transient risk of fever over other vaccines
   could outweigh all of the benefits gleaned from vaccination?
   That higher rates were seen in children with a history of COVID-19 suggests only that a child's infection history may have
   been a relevant consideration, and that vaccination decisions should have been a decision for a child's parents and doctors,
   based on their individual risk profile.
4. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that vaccination of infants and children would impact community transmission.
   Even if this is true, which is not established by the evidence, there is no reason that this should be a consideration. The health
   of children and the risk/benefit to them of receiving vaccination should have been the primary consideration. If this was not
   the case, one must question whether ATAGI's terms of reference were appropriate, in the public interest, and in line with
   Australia's obligations under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC).
5. ATAGI notes that there are currently constraints on the global availability and domestic supply of the Moderna vaccine for
   children aged 6 months to <5 years, which may persist until an alternative brand, variant-based or bivalent vaccines become
   available for this age group. Vaccine supply was one, among many, considerations in the ATAGI advice for this age group.
   While this may have been the case in August 2022, it is not true that global supply has continued to be an issue some 16
   months since these recommendations were made. Indeed, updated vaccines have since been developed and distributed, and
   yet our children are still waiting to be allowed access to any covid vaccine at all.

   EVIDENCE FOR VACCINATING UNDER 5s
   COVID-19 is a leading cause of death in children and young people. Covid causes 'substantially more deaths annually than
   any vaccine preventable disease historically in the recent period before vaccines became available' and COVID-19 is the
   leading infectious cause of death in children and young people in the US.8 Australia strongly recommends (and funds) the
   influenza vaccine for children under 5, yet Covid is thought to kill 10 times more people than influenza.
   Kompaniyets L, Bull-Otterson L, Boehmer TK, et al. in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published by the US CDC,
   referenced the significant risk of post-covid related symptoms and conditions and stated that "COVID-19 prevention
   strategies, including vaccination for all eligible persons aged >6 months, are critical to preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and
   subseguent illness, and reducing the public health impact ofpost-COVID symptoms and conditions among persons aged 0-17
   years".9
   ATAGI suggest that their main concern is the reduction in hospitalisation and severe disease, yet Rosa Duque, et al. found
   that the Pfizer (BNT162b2) paediatric vaccine provided substantial protection from COVID-19-associated hospitalization and
   moderate-to-severe disease due to a SARS-CoV-2 in paediatric populations that had low exposure to prior SARS-CoV-2
   variants, with vaccine effectiveness of 93.1% after 2 doses analysed during the Omicron BA.2 wave in Hong Kong.10
   A recent study showed that vaccine effectiveness of monovalent mRNA vaccines against confirmed infection during an
   Omicron XBB surge was 63.3% in fully vaccinated, infection-naive children and 74.6% against reinfections in previously

   COMMENTARY                                                                                                                                                   Figure 2
   Whilst this is a necessarily brief summary of the available evidence, there is more than sufficient evidence to conclude:
1. The reasoning used by ATAGI's to deny vaccination to the 6 months to 5 years cohort was faulty, took into account irrelevant
   considerations, did not consider the best interests of the child, was not adequately updated as new information came to
   light, and does not explain why Australian children under 5 are, to this day, being denied access to vaccination when their
   peers overseas are regularly receiving updated vaccines and boosters.
2. There is no administrative review mechanism to challenge ATAGI's reasoning or decisions. As a ministerially appointed
   committee, they serve at the Minister's behest, on terms set by the Minister. Whilst the ability of the Minister to seek expert
   advice is sensible, an apolitical structure with full accountability is essential to ensure that errors and oversights can be
   identified and rectified. The children of Australia have suffered because of the faulty reasoning used by ATAGI to deny them
   access to safe and effective vaccines. The WHO database suggests that 16 children in the 0-4 year age group have died. Could
   timely access to vaccines have prevented any of those deaths?
3. If it could be said that the reasons cited by ATAGI for denying under 5's access to vaccines was a result of their restricted
   Terms of Reference, then this simply highlights that a political process where the Minister appoints a committee to provide
   an answer within a limited scope, is notan appropriate way to manage a pandemic of a novel pathogen. The vaccine approval
   and recommendation process must be completely apolitical, transparent, and accountable.
4. ATAGI's restriction of vaccines to children with certain conditions or based upon limited definitions of who is deemed to be
   'at risk', placed Australian children and their families at unnecessary risk. The recommendations failed to take into account
   children's individual risk factors (e.g., not having had a prior covid infection, living with an immunocompromised, aged, or
   otherwise at-risk person). There should have been a procedure by which vaccination decisions could have been made by
   parents, in consultation with their child's treating doctors, based upon the individual child's best interests. Further, a policy
   which allows vaccination of a 5-year-old but denies protection to a 4 year 11-month-old discriminates on the basis of age.
5. ATAGI have not accurately represented the burden of severe disease, have misrepresented, downplayed and/or failed to
   consider the significant risk of post-Covid related symptoms and conditions (e.g., immune dysfunction, increased rate of
   diabetes, etc.) and failed to consider whether those risks may have been mitigated by vaccination.
6. Failure to make vaccines widely available has led to anti-vaccine sentiment as people began to doubt the safety and efficacy
   of the vaccines (e.g., if the vaccines worked, the government would recommend that we vaccinate our kids). There is some
   evidence that this sentiment is now extending to other childhood vaccines, which outcome was entirely foreseeable and
   preventable.
7. Communications to the Minister and his department were repeatedly answered with generic platitudes, failing to respond
   to the specific matters raised in the correspondence, and refusing to provide any useful information that would have allowed
   parents to make informed decisions for their children.
8. It is patently clear that the entire point of having the Minister appoint a committee to advise on these issues is so that that
   the committee can hide behind the terms of reference that the Minister gives them, and the Minister can hide behind the
   resultant recommendations of the committee so that, ultimately, no-one can be held accountable. This is unacceptable in an
   advanced democracy.
9. Given the clear evidence of the benefits of vaccination, ATAGI's refusal to allow under 5s to be vaccinated is
   incomprehensible. The stated reasons do not stand up to scrutiny. What logical rationale exists to deny vaccination to
   children under 5? One must wonder whether one possible implicit consideration on ATAGI's part, was that which was
   explicitly stated by JCVI in the UK, namely that, "there is an argument for allowing the virus to circulate amongst children
   which could provide broader immunity to the children and boost immunity in adults".12 Similar sentiments were expressed
   publicly by Prof Paul Kelly (Insiders, ABC, 15 March 2020) and              ster cott Morr      . This inquiry should seek to
   reassure parents that their children weren't, and aren't, being used as disease vectors to spread COVID-19 through the
   community in the futile and unethical pursuit of herd or hybrid immunity.
10. The Minister should immediately rectify these egregious errors by providing for a primary series of vaccines to be rolled out
   to all children under 5, and by permitting all children to be regularly boosted with the latest available vaccines. ATAGI, in its
   present form, should immediately be disbanded and replaced with a fully transparent, representative and accountable public
   body tasked with representing the best interests of Australian children, and the Australian public as a whole.
