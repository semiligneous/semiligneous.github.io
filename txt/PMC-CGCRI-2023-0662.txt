Introduction
On behalf of the Australian Council of State School Organisations (ACSSO), it is our privilege to
contribute to the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry. As a long-standing
advocate for the families and communities of Australia's government school students, ACSSO has
continuously championed the needs and rights of over 2.6 million students since its establishment in
1947.

Our organisation has a rich history of engaging with various state and territory parent organisations
and families, creating a cohesive national voice on public education matters. ACSSO firmly believes in
a government education system that is inclusive, equitable, and responsive to all students, regardless
of their backgrounds or circumstances.

The primary focus of our submission revolves around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
government education sector. We aim to show how the pandemic has affected students, families,
and communities involved in government schools across Australia. Our insights are drawn from our
extensive network and direct engagement with our diverse membership base.

However, we acknowledge our limitations in addressing all the terms of reference outlined in the
Inquiry. While ACSSO is deeply committed to representing the interests of our constituents, our
resources are finite, and our expertise in this response is primarily concentrated on the educational
aspect to students, families, and their communities of the pandemic's impact. Therefore, our
submission will focus on areas where our experience and knowledge are most pertinent, particularly
in understanding and articulating the challenges faced by students and families in the government
education sector during the pandemic.

We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this vital Inquiry and hope that our submission will
provide valuable perspectives on the educational implications of the pandemic. ACSSO remains
dedicated to ensuring that the voices of families and communities within the government school
system are heard and considered in shaping Australia's preparedness for future challenges.

ACSSO made two submissions to the government that we believe highlight the issues and provided
some crucial feedback:

    •       ACSSO Submission to Review of the impact of COVID-19 on school students with disability.
    •       Response to Covid -19 June 2020

Both these submissions were based on survey feedback (two nationwide surveys) and conversations
with families and principals around the nation.

Learning from Experience
In times of crisis, it's essential to have a coordinated approach to managing emergencies. That's why
ACSSO believes that a strengthened partnership between Federal and State/Territory governments
promotes unified decision-making and strategic planning. By working together, we can tackle
nationwide educational challenges more effectively.

The nation needs comprehensive crisis response plans to ensure preparedness for various types of
emergencies. These plans should incorporate scenarios and strategies derived from the COVID-19
experience. Additionally, clear and consistent communication channels between governments,
educational bodies, and families are crucial. Regular updates, easy-to-understand guidelines, and
open feedback mechanisms ensure that parents and communities are well-informed and can adapt
to changing situations.

Engaging parents and communities in developing and refining crisis response strategies is also vital.
This inclusion ensures that strategies are grounded in families' real experiences and needs, leading to
more practical solutions. Data and insights gathered from the pandemic experience can also inform
future policies and actions. This approach we believe, ensures that decisions are evidence-based and
tailored to address specific challenges identified during past crises. A time of crisis is NOT the time
for schools to start a family engagement strategy - schools should have an integrated family
engagement.

Investing in the training and preparedness of school communities to handle crisis situations is
essential. This includes equipping them with the skills and tools needed for remote teaching,
adapting curriculums to changing circumstances, and providing support for student wellbeing in
times of crisis. Ensuring equitable access to resources, such as technology and internet connectivity,
is also crucial. Future strategies should consider the diverse socio-economic backgrounds of students
to ensure that all have equal opportunities to continue their education during crises.

Establishing robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of crisis
response strategies is important. These mechanisms can help identify areas for improvement and
make timely adjustments to strategies as situations evolve. The ultimate goal should be to build a
resilient educational system capable of withstanding future crises. This involves long-term planning,
including developing flexible learning models and infrastructure that can adapt to various emergency
scenarios. Learning from both national and international best practices in crisis management within
the educational sector can also offer valuable insights. Sharing experiences and strategies with other
countries can help develop more robust and comprehensive approaches.

We know for a fact that many students did not engage in school at all during the lockdowns.
Learning from Experience calls for a proactive, collaborative, and well-resourced approach to future
crisis management in education. By integrating the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic,
Australian Federal and State/Territory governments can better prepare and support schools,
teachers, students, and families in navigating and overcoming future challenges.

Technology Access for Students
Our research clearly shows that many students did not have access to online learning. Schools should
be commended for using their already limited resources to support young people with internet
connection; devices so they no longer needed to share or in areas where the internet was
challenging, or students were unfamiliar with the workings of online.

ACSSO advocates for providing all government school students with laptops and effective internet
access. This comprehensive and multifaceted approach addresses numerous crucial aspects of
modern education.

In today's world, access to technology is crucial for students' success. It's imperative that every
student in government schools has access to a laptop or a similar device to bridge the digital divide.
This initiative goes beyond just providing hardware; it also ensures that these devices come with the
necessary software and are tailored to meet the unique educational needs of each student. By
providing access to technology, we enable students to learn, explore, and grow in ways that were
previously impossible, ultimately setting them up for success in today's digital age.

Ensuring high-speed and dependable internet access for all students, regardless of location, is
paramount. ACSSO suggests an all-encompassing digital literacy program that caters to students,
teachers, and parents. This program should offer training in using digital tools, understanding digital
safety, and promoting responsible online behaviour.

Students with disabilities require special attention to ensure that they have access to technology that
caters to their individualised learning needs, including adaptive hardware and software. The
provision of technology must also come with a robust support system, including maintenance and
technical support, to ensure the smooth functioning of these tools.

    7%^ national voice for fanniiieSj carers; and cowuwxnities in government education
In addition to laptops and internet access, equitable access to digital educational resources such as
online textbooks, educational software, and subscription-based educational platforms is crucial.
Strategic partnerships with technology companies can provide cost-effective solutions, including
discounted devices, free software licenses for educational tools, and high-speed internet services.

Upgrading the digital infrastructure in schools is essential to support technology usage, including
high-speed internet, digital whiteboards, and other interactive learning tools. This ensures seamless
learning and prepares education systems for sudden shifts to remote learning, as seen during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

The effectiveness of technology usage in education should be monitored and evaluated through an
assessment system. This system would evaluate students' adaptation to digital learning and identify
areas that require additional support.

Parental involvement and support are vital in their children's digital learning. It is crucial to provide
resources and training to assist parents in supporting their children's use of technology for
educational purposes.

With the increased use of digital technology, securing students' devices and networks is crucial.
Educating students about online safety is also essential.

Our recommendation for technology access for students goes beyond hardware provision. It adopts
a holistic approach to digital education, aiming to ensure that all students, irrespective of their
background or location, can equally participate in and benefit from the digital revolution in
education.

Wellbeing and Mental Health Support
Prioritising student wellbeing and mental health is a critical component of a comprehensive response
plan as students transition back to full-time school attendance. Various dimensions of student
wellbeing and mental health support should be addressed to ensure a more detailed and
comprehensive strategy.

Schools can implement holistic wellbeing programs that cater to students' physical, emotional, social,
and mental health. These programs should include activities and resources that promote
mindfulness, stress management, healthy lifestyle habits, and social skills development. Additionally,
access to counselling and psychological services within schools should be enhanced by employing
trained mental health professionals such as school psychologists, counsellors, and social workers.
This will provide individual and group support to students who need it the most.

Teachers and school staff should receive training to identify signs of students' mental health issues
and provide initial support and guidance. This training should include strategies to create a
supportive classroom environment that is sensitive to students' mental health needs. Peer support
programs can also be established where older students are trained to offer guidance and support to
their younger peers, fostering a sense of community and belonging, which is vital for mental well­
being.

Engaging parents in the mental health and well-being conversation is essential. Workshops and
resources can be provided for parents to understand mental health issues, recognise signs in their
children, and learn how to provide support at home. Integrating resilience-building activities into the


                              Australian Council of State School Organisations
    7%^ national voice for fanviieSj carers; and co^nnaanities in govemn^ent education
curriculum can also help students develop coping skills to manage stress and bounce back from
challenges.

Creating a safe and inclusive school environment, where diversity is celebrated, and bullying is
actively addressed, is important for student wellbeing. Implementing regular mental health
assessments can help identify students who may be struggling early, allowing for timely intervention.
Schools should also collaborate with external mental health organisations and experts to access
additional resources and expertise.

Tailored support for students who may be more vulnerable to mental health issues, such as those
with prior mental health conditions, learning disabilities, or those experiencing socio-economic
hardships, should be provided. Offering flexible learning options for students who might find the
transition back to full-time attendance challenging, such as phased transitions, blended learning
models, or adjusted schedules, can also help.

Recognising that the aftermath of a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic can have long-term effects,
schools should prepare to provide ongoing mental health support to address issues such as anxiety,
grief, and trauma. Ongoing professional development opportunities in the field of student mental
health and wellbeing for educators and school mental health professionals are also essential. Finally,
forming partnerships with local community groups and healthcare providers can enhance the
support network available to students and their families.

A focus on wellbeing and mental health support calls for a multi-dimensional approach that
encompasses a range of strategies, from direct mental health services to creating supportive and
inclusive school environments. This approach aims to ensure that all students receive the support
they need to transition back to full-time school attendance successfully and to thrive in their
educational journey.

Curriculum Adjustments
We recommend curriculum adjustments, focusing on reviewing curriculum requirements to
emphasise key elements essential for student engagement and learning continuity, which is a vital
strategy in the evolving education landscape.

Streamlining curriculum content is a crucial step. This involves eliminating redundancy and
condensing topics to create a more cohesive and engaging learning experience.

A flexible curriculum design is essential to meet the various learning needs of students, whether in
the classroom, online, or in a hybrid setting. Given the increasing role of technology in education,
integrating digital literacy skills into the curriculum is a must. This includes teaching students how to
use technology for learning and communication effectively and responsibly.

Focusing on skill development, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and
collaboration, empowers students to navigate the challenges of the 21st century. Personalised
learning paths that cater to the diverse learning styles and paces of students are also essential.

Incorporating social-emotional learning (SEL) into the curriculum supports students' emotional
wellbeing and helps them develop interpersonal skills, empathy, and emotional intelligence.
Encouraging the application of knowledge through project-based learning and real-world problem-



                              Australian Council of State School Organisations
    7%^ national voice for fanviieSj carers; and co^nnaanities in govemn^ent education
solving activities helps students see the relevance of their education and apply their learning in
practical contexts.

Regular curriculum reviews and updates are necessary to ensure that educational content remains
current, relevant, and aligned with the latest educational research and societal needs. Stakeholder
involvement in curriculum development and review processes, including educators, students,
parents, and industry experts, ensures that multiple perspectives are considered, and the curriculum
is responsive to the needs of the community.

Providing ongoing professional development for educators supports them in adapting to curriculum
changes and employing effective teaching strategies that align with the revised curriculum. Aligning
assessments with the adjusted curriculum is essential to accurately measure student understanding
and progress in the key areas of focus.

This recommendation for curriculum adjustments is about creating a dynamic, relevant, and student-
centred curriculum that not only focuses on essential academic competencies but also prepares
students for the challenges and opportunities of the future. This approach requires collaboration,
innovation, and a commitment to continuous improvement in educational practices.

Family Engagement in Education
ACSSO strongly believes in prioritising family engagement as a fundamental aspect of its mission. To
establish a robust and meaningful home-school relationship, adopting an all-encompassing and
seamless approach is essential. The school must maintain regular and open channels of
communication with families. This can be achieved through various means such as disseminating
newsletters and emails, organising parent-teacher meetings, and providing digital platforms for
parents to monitor their child's progress and school activities.

Encouraging parental involvement in school events is another effective approach to building a
stronger connection between families and the school. Organising educational workshops for parents
is critical to support their children's learning at home. These workshops can cover topics such as
understanding the curriculum, strategies for homework assistance, and guidance on managing digital
learning platforms.

Creating opportunities for feedback and collaboration is another critical aspect of family
engagement. Parents can offer feedback and collaborate with teachers and school administrators
through surveys, focus groups, or parent advisory councils, ensuring that parental perspectives are
considered in school decision-making.

Fostering strong parent-teacher partnerships is also essential. Encouraging regular and meaningful
communication about students' progress, challenges, and achievements can be achieved through
parent-teacher conferences, personalised progress reports, and collaborative goal setting for
students.

Hosting family-centred school events can help families feel more connected to the school
community. These events may include family learning nights, cultural festivals, and parent-child
workshops.

    7%^ national voice for fanviieSj carers; and co^nnaanities in govemn^ent education
Recognising and supporting the diversity of family structures and backgrounds is critical. This
includes providing multilingual communication for non-English speaking families and understanding
the unique needs of families from various cultural, socio-economic, and educational backgrounds.

Integrating family perspectives and experiences into the curriculum where possible is also highly
beneficial. Projects that include family histories or cultural practices can help bridge the gap between
home and school.

Leveraging technology to enhance family engagement is another effective approach. Online
platforms for tracking student progress, virtual parent-teacher meetings, and online resources that
families can use to support learning at home can all be helpful.

Developing early involvement and orientation programs for families, especially those transitioning
into the school system for the first time, can help establish a foundation for strong relationships from
the beginning.

Having specific communication plans in place for crises is also essential. This will ensure that families
are kept informed and supported during challenging times, with clear, empathetic, and frequent
communication.

Finally, it is very important to empower parents to be active partners in their child's education by
providing them with the necessary resources and support. This can include guidance on creating
conducive learning environments at home and motivating and engaging their children in learning
activities.

In summary, ACSSO's focus on family engagement in education involves a comprehensive approach
that fosters strong and proactive home-school relationships. By establishing these connections early
and maintaining them through various strategies, schools can create a supportive and collaborative
educational environment that benefits students, families, and educators alike.

Inclusive Education
ACSSO believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges and opportunities for
Inclusive Education. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, the pandemic has highlighted
the importance of flexible and accessible educational resources. This means providing culturally
appropriate digital learning tools and resources that can be accessed from remote areas. Community
engagement and support have also become more important than ever, ensuring that families are
involved in the educational process and have the necessary resources to support their children's
learning from home.

Students with disabilities have faced unique challenges during the pandemic, emphasizing the need
for adaptable and personalized learning environments. Innovative approaches, such as enhancing
online learning platforms with accessibility features, providing specialized support and resources for
at-home learning, and maintaining regular communication between teachers, students, and
caregivers are necessary to ensure the continuity of education for these students.

Non-English speaking background students have also faced distinct challenges during the pandemic,
including language barriers to accessing online education and a lack of in-person support. ACSSO
advocates for multilingual support in digital learning platforms, such as translation services and
bilingual educators. Additionally, cultural elements should be included in online curricula and virtual


                              Australian Council of State School Organisations
    72^ national voice for families, carers, and communities in government education
peer support networks should be fostered to maintain a sense of community and cultural connection
during periods of remote learning.

The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for an inclusive education system that is adaptable,
resilient, and responsive to the diverse needs of all students. By integrating these pandemic-era
insights, we can build a more inclusive educational landscape that can withstand future challenges
and provide equitable opportunities for all learners.

National Procurement for Safety Materials
The recent COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of having a robust and
responsive national procurement system for safety materials. The Australian Council of State School
Organisations (ACSSO) puts forward a suggestion that the Federal Government leverage its
procurement power to bulk buy safety materials for national use, especially in preparation for future
crises. This approach, informed by the challenges faced during the pandemic, would aim to ensure a
steady and reliable supply of essential safety items such as personal protective equipment (PRE),
sanitisers, and medical supplies. By centralising the procurement process, the government can
negotiate better prices, maintain higher standards of quality, and ensure equitable distribution
across all states and territories, including remote and underserved areas.

Furthermore, the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a strategic
stockpile of safety materials, which can be rapidly deployed in response to any public health
emergency. ACSSO's proposal includes the establishment of a national reserve of critical safety
supplies, managed and monitored by the Federal Government. This reserve would act as a buffer
against supply chain disruptions, ensuring that schools, hospitals, and other essential services have
immediate access to necessary safety materials during a crisis. The stockpile would need to be
regularly reviewed and replenished, considering the shelf life of different items and the evolving
nature of potential threats, thus maintaining its relevance and effectiveness over time.

Lastly, ACSSO emphasises the importance of a coordinated approach to distributing and utilising
these safety materials. The lessons from the pandemic have shown that clear communication and
collaboration between federal, state/territory, and local entities are paramount in managing a crisis
efficiently. The proposed national procurement strategy must be accompanied by a framework
outlining how resources are allocated and distributed in various scenarios, ensuring transparency
and fairness in the process. This would also involve training and guidelines for institutions and
communities on properly using and managing the safety materials, thereby maximising their
effectiveness in safeguarding public health. Overall, ACSSO's recommendation for a government-led
national procurement of safety materials we believe is a forward-thinking approach, aiming to build a
more resilient and prepared nation in the face of future emergencies.

Student Feedback Collection
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the education sector, significantly
affecting students' learning experiences. In response, there is a growing recognition of the
importance of directly gathering feedback from students with diverse backgrounds to gain insights
into their educational experiences during this period. This feedback is critical for understanding the
varying impacts of remote learning, school closures, and other pandemic-related educational
disruptions on different student groups. By engaging students in a dialogue, policymakers can
uncover various demographics' specific challenges and needs, including those from marginalised or


                             Australian Council of State School Organisations
    72^ national voice for families, carers, and communities in government education
disadvantaged communities. This ensures that their voices are directly heard and addressed in future
educational strategies.

Collecting student feedback also provides an opportunity to understand the effectiveness of the
various pedagogical approaches adopted during the pandemic. Students' perspectives can offer
valuable insights into what worked and what didn't in terms of online learning, hybrid models, and
other instructional adaptations made during school closures. This feedback is particularly crucial for
tailoring educational practices to better suit the needs of students with disabilities, those facing
digital divide issues, and non-native English speakers. By analysing students' experiences and
suggestions, schools can refine their teaching methodologies, resource allocation, and support
services to enhance all students' learning experiences and academic outcomes.

 Involving students in feedback empowers them and fosters a sense of ownership in their educational
journey. It's important to create multiple and accessible channels for students to express their views,
such as surveys, focus groups, and digital platforms, to ensure inclusivity and ease of participation.
This inclusive approach not only helps in gathering comprehensive feedback but also in building a
more resilient and responsive education system. By understanding and addressing the unique
challenges faced by students during the COVID-19 pandemic, educators can develop more effective
and equitable educational strategies, paving the way for a more adaptive and inclusive education
system in the post-pandemic world.

Addressing Educational Inequities
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant educational inequities, particularly in the treatment
disparities between government and non-government educational sectors. ACSSO notes that
students from the two sectors often received different levels of support and resources during the
crisis, leading to a widening gap in educational quality and access. Government schools, especially in
underprivileged areas, faced severe challenges regarding resources and support, whereas non­
government schools often had better access to digital learning tools and infrastructure. This disparity
not only affected the immediate learning experiences of students during the pandemic but also had
long-term implications for educational equity and social mobility.

To address these inequities, ACSSO advocates for more equitable policies that ensure all schools
receive adequate support regardless of their government or non-government status. This includes
equitable funding, access to quality teaching resources, and robust infrastructural support to handle
crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring that all students, irrespective of their socio-economic
background, have access to high-quality education is crucial. The pandemic has highlighted the need
for a resilient education system that can adapt to unforeseen challenges while maintaining a focus on
equity and inclusivity.

Additionally, ACSSO emphasises the importance of bridging the digital divide that became glaringly
apparent during the pandemic. Many students in government schools lacked access to reliable
internet and digital devices, hindering their ability to participate in online learning. Addressing this
digital divide is essential for creating a level playing field where all students have the opportunity to
engage with digital learning platforms and resources. Policies aimed at providing digital devices,
improving internet connectivity, and training teachers and students in digital literacy are vital steps
towards mitigating this divide.

    7%^ national voice for families, carers., and co^nnaanities in government education
Finally, ACSSO calls for a long-term strategy that includes monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to
ensure that policies addressing educational inequities are effectively implemented and make a real
difference in students' lives. This includes gathering data on student performance, access to
educational resources, and overall well-being to assess the impact of these policies. By continuously
evaluating the effectiveness of educational strategies and making necessary adjustments, ACSSO
believes it is possible to build an education system that is not only resilient in the face of crises like
the COVID-19 pandemic but also fundamentally fair and inclusive, offering every student the chance
to succeed.

Clarification and Consistency in Messaging
During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the key issues identified in our surveys was
the lack of clarity and consistency in messaging from various authorities. Public health information,
safety protocols, and guidelines were often communicated in ways that led to confusion among the
public, including families and students. This ambiguity was particularly problematic in the context of
education, where students, parents, and educators struggled to adapt to rapidly changing situations.
ACSSO advocates for clearer and more consistent communication strategies. There is a need for
straightforward, easily understandable messaging to effectively guide the public during such crises.

ACSSO's advocacy is grounded in the understanding that clear communication is essential for
effective crisis management, especially in the educational sector. We suggest the development of
standardised communication protocols to be used during emergencies, ensuring that all stakeholders
receive accurate and timely information. This involves coordinating with health authorities,
government agencies, and educational institutions to streamline the flow of information. Such
coordination would prevent the dissemination of conflicting messages and ensure that the
community receives unified guidance on important matters such as school closures, online learning
protocols, and health and safety measures in educational settings.

Moreover, there is a need for tailored communication strategies to address the diverse needs of
different communities. During the pandemic, it became evident that one-size-fits-all messaging was
ineffective for everyone. Different regions, cultural groups, and socio-economic sectors have varying
needs and challenges, which must be considered when disseminating information. For instance,
communities with limited access to digital technology require different communication methods
than those in urban settings. Similarly, non-English speaking communities need information in their
native languages to ensure proper understanding and compliance with guidelines.

Finally, ACSSO advocates for the involvement of educational stakeholders in developing these
communication strategies. Parents/Carers, teachers, school administrators, and even students can
provide valuable insights into what works best in the context of educational settings. Their
involvement would ensure that the strategies are practical and relevant and help build trust within
the educational community. By fostering a collaborative approach to communication, the aim would
be to establish a more effective and responsive framework for managing future crises, ensuring that
all educational community members are well-informed and prepared to navigate challenges
effectively.

Parental Involvement in Decision-Making
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical role of parental involvement in the educational
decision-making process, particularly regarding "learning at home" arrangements. ACSSO has

previously highlighted the significant gap that existed in many areas where parents were not
adequately involved in decisions impacting their children's education during the shift to remote
learning. This lack of involvement often led to challenges in implementing home learning strategies
effectively, as many parents felt unprepared and uninformed about how to best support their
children's education under these new and rapidly changing circumstances.

Recognising this, ACSSO suggests that daily updates and more effective communication strategies
between schools and families are necessary. We advocate for a more inclusive approach where
parents are not just recipients of information but active participants in decision-making. This could
involve regular virtual meetings, detailed newsletters, and accessible platforms for feedback where
parents can voice their concerns and suggestions. Such an approach ensures that parents are kept in
the loop about their children's learning progress, changes in educational policies, and the rationale
behind decisions made by educational authorities. By fostering this level of transparency and
collaboration, schools can create a more supportive and responsive educational environment that
considers the realities of home learning.

Moreover, our recommendations extend to providing parents with the resources and guidance they
need to effectively facilitate their children's learning. This includes offering workshops or online
resources on how to support children's learning at home, understanding digital platforms used for
remote learning, and strategies to manage the emotional and psychological well-being of both
parents and children during such disruptive times. Ensuring that parents are equipped with the
knowledge and tools they need enhances the effectiveness of home learning and alleviates some of
the stress and uncertainty associated with it. In essence, ACSSO's focus on strengthening parental
involvement in decision-making and providing adequate support mirrors a broader shift towards
recognising the integral role of families in the educational ecosystem, especially highlighted during
the challenges posed by the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

Our response in this submission we believe highlights the importance of adopting a comprehensive,
fair, and family-oriented crisis management strategy in education. Our recommendations are based
on a thorough understanding of the diverse needs of students and families throughout Australia, and
we urge Federal and State/Territory governments to work together in a collaborative and well-
resourced manner to address these issues effectively.
