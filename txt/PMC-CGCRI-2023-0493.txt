To Whom It May Concern,



I am writing to express my deep concern over the Victorian lockdowns, mandates and rules around
Covid-19 and how they have negatively affected myself, my children and my family. I believe that these
measures have not only been excessive, but have also caused significant harm to families and the wider
community.



Firstly, let me share how my family has been impacted. The lockdowns have had a detrimental effect on
our mental health and wellbeing. We have suffered from feelings of isolation, anxiety and depression
due to being cut off from our friends and loved ones for extended periods of time. The restrictions have
left us feeling trapped and disconnected from the world around us.



Our financial situation has also been severely impacted.
which has put us in a difficult financial position. We are struggling to pay bills and put food on the table
for our children. This has caused a great deal of stress and anxiety, and has made it difficult for us to plan
for the future.



The education of our children has also been negatively affected. They have been struggling to keep up
with their school work due to remote learning, and we are concerned about the long-term impact this
may have on their academic development. We believe that they are missing out on important social and
educational experiences that are essential for their growth and development.



Additionally, the lockdowns have put a strain on our relationships. We have been living in close quarters
with each other for months, and this has led to increased tension and arguments. The children have also
been affected by this, as they are picking up on the stress and anxiety that we are feeling.



Furthermore, the stress caused by the lockdowns and the financial struggles has led to health issues for
myself                 We have been experiencing elevated levels of stress, along with physical
symptoms such as headaches and stomach problems. The toll that this has taken on our physical and
mental health cannot be overstated.



In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Victorian lockdowns, mandates and rules around Covid-19 have
had a devastating impact on myself, my family and the wider community. The harm they have caused in
terms of mental health decline, financial struggles, children falling behind in education, relationship
break downs, stress causing health issues, and loss of employment cannot be ignored. I urge you to
consider the seriousness of what these mandates caused.
Sincerely,



Katie Syle
