Drawing on the experience of the last few years, we want to ask the questions

       •         What could we do differently? Or do again?
       •         What is most important in preparing for another pandemic?

In relation to this question, I have a suggestion.

When the COVID vaccines were released, every person received a text to their
phone asking about the side effects after a few days and after two weeks.

When SARS-CoV-2 finally arrived in WA and people were registering their RAT or
getting PCRs, there were no texts asking about COVID symptoms. If this had been
done after a week, a month, and 6 and 12 weeks, we would have a database on how
COVID affected the population.

People against the vaccination were on social media broadcasting that 139,000+
adverse events were recorded, but there were no ‘adverse events’ from COVID
recorded as a rebuttal.

The infrastructure was already in place for this to happen. I would like to know why it
wasn’t enacted.
