To the COVID Inquiry,

I write as the parent of a child




In 2013, our daughter had a




When the new novel vaccines were created for COVID we were justifiably sceptical and
knew we could not possibly                                                         It
would've been an unthinkable cruelty to risk further harm
       and yet, this is exactly what the Australian government asked us to do.

The political messaging through the media threatened our already traumatised and
struggling family with the removal of^^^^^^^^^^Hsupports if we didn't vaccinate our
child. We were left to make the heart wrenching decision of whether we risk her life
(through vaccination) or risk losing our^^^^^supports that keep her safe and our family
functioning day to day.

I could not believe that it was my own government committing this absolute abuse on
fundamental human rights and targeting vulnerable Australians.

My daughter, as a child, was low risk for complications related to covid and the vaccines
didn't seem to be acting as traditional vaccines by addressing transmission so, her status
had a very mild, almost negligible impact on others.

We asked our doctor to provide a vaccine exemption for our daughter. He explained the risk
of vaccination for our daughter based on her medical history even admitting it may "kill her"
but, refused to write the exemption explaining the the government was 'cracking down' on
doctor's writing exemptions and might lose his job...for telling the truth? What country were
we were living in!
The political messaging and fear mongering through the media continued with some of our
team staff convinced our beautiful daughter was all of a sudden dangerous. The rejection of
her as somehow 'dirty & unclean' was heart breaking for our family as we already battle
societal stigma as a person with disability. Why was our government actively creating &
perpetuating this division? It was alarming.

This was only the beginning.
                       due to the mandates. Not only did we lose amazing staff who were
unwilling to take a personal risk with a vaccine with no long term safety data we were left
with minimal^^^^^supports.^^^^^^H^^^M^^^^^H^^^B-this removal of
supports due to the government response put her at a greater risk than covid which was at
this stage evident to be a mild illness for most people.

In order to survive the devastating impact of the government's response, we had to use my
             father and siblings to cover gaps in the care for our daughter. This meant our
other kids needed time off school in order to provide the support required. We had no
choice. In furthur cruelty, we were told that the time our other children had off school was
reportable. We were being threatened at every turn by our own government when we were
simply trying to survive a situation created by the government.

The government response to the pandemic caused significant trauma to our family. Our
story reflects the story of many others in the disability community. The disability community
is full of people with similar vaccine injury stories to my daughter. Although rare, she is not
alone.

Please remember that rare things happen to real people and we are real Australians who,
on behalf of the disability community, demand the Australian government be held
accountable for the atrocities committed against the most vulnerable during the pandemic.



Sincerely,
