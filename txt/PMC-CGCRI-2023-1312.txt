Points the COVID enquiry should take into consideration which have been missed in all the
scope of the enquiry.
I work for a disability NDIS provider and COVID measures were so stressful to our clients and
the organisation. The measures have caused a big impact on the industry with huge
numbers of employees losing their jobs in the sector due to vaccine mandates.
    - families with disabilities lived in fear that they would lose their supports if they did
        not comply with vaccine mandates. They did not dare to say if they were not
        vaccinated and in many cases, they missed out on therapy services or lost their place
        on long waiting lists.
    - NDIS provided bonus payments for organisations that could prove, facilitated
        vaccination of vulnerable individuals without care that these were informed of all
        the risks involved.
    - There was not sufficient information available at an understandable level for people
        with learning disabilities to understand the risks and provide an informed choice
    - Majority of accommodation providers insisted on their clients and employees having
        vaccinations for them to keep their services and accommodation so vaccinations
        happened out of fear with a monetary motivation
    - our clients who were attending therapy, were traumatised with mask wearing and
        their development stagnated during this time.
    - We have witnessed significant number of unusual genetic disorders, never seen
        before which appear to have an environmental cause - clusters of similar symptoms
        that cannot be explained within children born during the COVID period
    - We have seen a high number of children displaying significant communication and
        social difficulties due to the lack of social contact during this time
    - Our employees sick rate has significantly increased with lots of issues with frequent
        sick leave that we did not see prior to COVID

The COVID measures have caused significantly more issues than they have helped
