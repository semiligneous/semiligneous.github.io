INQUIRY INTO THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

I am a retired engineer who is interested in the latest medical research results.

THE USE OF mRNA VACCINES

Early in the Covid-19 campaign, I was happy to accept three Pfizer vaccine shots.
However, when I became aware of the direct effect of the mRNA vaccines on the blood
and how it can lead in some cases to an excess of heart lung related deaths (ref #1), I
decided to not get any more shots of the vaccine.

I was not altogether happy about the alleged necessity of having an ongoing course of
so-called booster shots, particularly knowing that the virus is carried in our nasal
passages, and that the vaccine does not reduce this capability of retransmitting the
virus. So I was happy to make the personal choice to restrict interaction with others and
to use a face mask when in public to limit expressing the virus from my nose.

I was also very suspicious of the downgrading of other views, particularly downplaying
the use of established oral treatments that did not involve the use of injections. There
should never be a separation of views into the categories of “information” and
“disinformation.” Rather, all results should be taken on board without being pre-judged
in this way.

ACTIONS BY THE COMMONEALTH IN FUTURE PANDEMICS

In hindsight, it seems that individual countries such as Australia should be much more
willing to do it’s own evaluation of the available data rather than just accept what other
authorities such as the FDA and the CDC in the United States appear to mandate.
