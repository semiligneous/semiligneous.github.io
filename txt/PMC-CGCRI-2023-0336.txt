JENNIFER RO ETT,

Please record my submission that we need a full enquiry as to the decisions made

During the pandemic and how some Doctors with exceptional experience in medicine

In these areas was silenced.     Excess Deaths & Mental health since lock down and mandates.




    1.   Why not discussion was allowed to be heard from Doctors that had alternative ideas for
         helping Australians prevent Covid other than vaccines.
    2.   Why there was NO encouragement to strengthen our natural immunity with Vitamin C or
         any other vitamins for foods that could help.
    3.   Why there was NO suggestion to supplement with known herbs & vitamins that could
         Strengthen natural immunity
   4.         Why it was mandated for healthy people to be injected rather than just the vulnerable
    5.        Why the fast food industry was allowed to carry on while quality food outlets were closed



         Exit the WHO


         1.           Every country has different culture, climate & population
         2.           Human rights should cover the choice the make decisions for your own body
         3.   A world wide organization funded by a Microsoft Virus expert who is not trained
              medically or scientifically should not make decisions for humans
         4.   Australia has a mild climate compared to other countries, shorter winter, hotter
              summers, and plenty of space.
         5.           WHO is a self elected group of people wanting to make decisions for humanity
