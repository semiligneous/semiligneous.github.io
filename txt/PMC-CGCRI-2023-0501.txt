           Reflections from a partner of a vaccine injured person

It's been a journey through hell for^^^| myself and the family over the last 15+ months. After her
first job-mandated Covid-vaccination in December 2021, what began relatively innocuously with
tingling feet progressed into a myriad of debilitating symptoms that included heart palpitations, itching,
fatigue, nausea, headaches, insomnia and intense panic. By far the toughest times have been when
she stated to me that she genuinely ‘felt like she was dying' which 3 or 4 times led to her being taken
off in an ambulance in front                          It is hard not to believe she may die when looking
at her, the weight she lost, her mindset at the time and also the lack of diagnosis and clarity about
potential treatment. The symptoms themselves were like a lottery wheel- spinning the wheel each
morning and finding out what we would be dealing with that day.

Over the period that this all occurred we had multiple trips to ER, and saw multiple well-meaning
doctors and specialists including cardiologists and neurologists, several of whom dismissed^^^^l
symptoms as not vaccine induced. The community which kept us sane at this dark time were two
forums we found filled with people with not only similar symptoms, but similar progressions and
timelines. Reading their horrific stories was traumatic but also gave us hope that a number of them
were beginning to see symptoms dissipate to some level after a few months and that we were not
alone. The other similarity with these fellow patients was the number of experts they had seen and the
lack of clarity they were left with also.

We were fortunate that a couple of months into this saga we saw a fantastic functional doctor in
            She ran more comprehensive blood tests and put^^^Hon high doses of magnesium,
Vitamin C, Vitamin D and many other supplements similar to how those with ‘long Covid' are treated.
Acupuncture and massage also appeared to help and these combined started her on the long road to
what we hope is full recovery. 15 months in, the products that seem most beneficial to^^^Hare
different classes of antihistamines and low-dose naltrexone (LDN). Regular fasting (16:8), eating a
low-histamine diet, primarily plant-based has also helped. The recovery is anything but linear, but
ultimately time and rest is proving to be the best healer at this point.

For myself personally I had to dig really deep. For the majority of 2022, I was juggling full-time work,
parenting three children at home, doing the vast majority involved in the housework and caring for
^^^|(often with her waking in the night in a panic). This was nearly completely untenable at times.
Finding even just 10 minutes to recharge myself was a challenge but necessary. I didn't gain much
pleasure talking with others about it (with rare exception) as there was a lack of total understanding
from people as they either didn't gain the gravity of what was occurring, couldn't do much to assist
due to the complexity of the situation or believed that perhaps it was in^^^^Hmind and that anxiety
was the cause not a symptom.

The challenge for myself and us, was not necessarily that^^^lwas unwell (millions of families
experience this every day). The challenge was the lack of clarity from experts, the cost of some
relationships and the financial cost (despite having private health, none of the costs which at this point
total^^^^H + lost income) were covered.

We were extremely blessed to have good support from family and some close friends. These people
know who they are and don't need to be named, but thank you.


                                      and as more research has come out (and cynically; I believe the
‘climate’ surrounding vaccine injuries has changed) this has been validated by a number of doctors
and specialists. Here are some excerpts:
        From primary treating Dr ***
                                                                                   These are real
        diagnoses, and they are linked to the vaccine through research. “Are real and result from a
        multi-system dysfunction following her Pfizer Covid vaccination.”
    •   From cardiologist ***: "“My impression on first meeting her is that she has symptoms which
        are very similar to many of the patients I am seeing with vaccine adverse events (and for that
        matter, long COVID) which broadly fall into a category of




    •   From treating Dr *** in a letter to our primary GP: “I would certainly agree with you that her
        presentation seems consistent with an immune mediated disorder triggered by the mRNA
        vaccine.”
        From American GP specialists long covid clinic IncellDX which includes|              blood test
        and document including the following quote: “According to              IncellKine report, she has




From someone who previously had no significant issues with her physical or mental health,^^^B
has been left physically and emotionally debilitated. The lack of diagnosis, clarity, recognition and
prognosis has certainly harmed her recovery even further. In my opinion, the way that this situation
occurred, via a mandate amplified it further. In the era of inclusion the irony of the situation was not
lost on me- we speak of inclusion, and then when people have a different health/medical belief (yes
that is allowed- science is not always black/white; it certainly wasn’t in^^^^^case), suddenly they
aren't included, they are segregated. If^^^Hhad taken the vaccine voluntarily and not under
coercion it would have made the whole situation somewhat more palatable. If she had chosen not to
be vaccinated and then got extremely sick (or heaven forbid died) of Covid-19 at least it was her bed,
and she had laid in it. Instead we were lying in a bed not entirely of our making, where knowledge of
potential adverse side effects such as those she was suffering were not publicly available to us and
for points of this journey we have felt like a 21st century version of the trolley problem (popularised by
Thomson, J. 1976):




I implore those reading this to acknowledge that this vaccine wasn't ‘safe and effective' for everyone.
That despite this ‘trolley’ hitting us, we deserve acknowledgement, apology and financial/emotional
support to recover to the best of our current situations allow.^^^^^H, myself and^^^^^^^^|
the toll of this continues.
