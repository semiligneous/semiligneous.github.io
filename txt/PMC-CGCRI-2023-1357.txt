Submission to the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry
Panel

Personal introduction

I am writing to support the demand for a Royal Commission into the Coalition and Labor federal
governments' mismanagement of the so-called 'COVID-19 response' as the most responsible
outcome of the Panel's investigation owing to the nation to avert such indefensible and punishing
measures being inflicted on the Australian public ever again.

 I have been a teacher in adult education for more than 30 years and have been working in the
tertiary sector for over twelve. I have a Master of Applied Linguistics from Macquarie University and
a PhD in Medicine (Psychiatry) from the University of Adelaide. I support the activities of non­
government organisations and volunteer community groups in raising public awareness of social
justice issues.

Submission

I submit that the following list compromises violations committed by one or both the federal
governments against the Australian electorate:

    •   Unprecedented imposition of societal lockdowns, which contradicts the Australian Health
        Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza (2019) in which no such draconian measures are
        mentioned.
    •   Severely limited access to primary and secondary education for children and tertiary
        education for adults, with documented harm to childhood cognitive and emotional
        development.
    •   Groundless health information promulgated concerning masking and 'social distancing',
        neither of which have any validated support from the research literature.
    •   Failure to promote the targeted protection of those most at risk - the elderly and
        vulnerable.
    •   Total exclusion or strict restriction of families visiting terminally or acutely ill patients in
        hospitals or aged care settings.
    •   Institutional denial of the benefits of early intervention treatments such as ivermectin and
        hydroxychloroquine and denial of access to these medications.
    •   Human clinical trial of an experimental modified RNA gene therapy injection with no
        adequate safety or efficacy data.
    •   Legal immunity granted to pharmaceutical companies manufacturing the COVID-19
        injectable product.
    •        Trashing of the Australian economy that may take at least a decade from which to recover.
    •   Corrupt funding of media corporations to promulgate a campaign aimed to escalate
        widespread panic rather than instil calm.
    •   Intimidation and censuring of doctors and healthcare professionals by AHPRA and ATAGI
        with threats concerning disciplinary action or loss of licences for deviating from or
        challenging the official narrative.
    •   Violation of the private doctor-patient relationship founded from time immemorial on the
        doctor's clinical expertise and judgement.
    •   Cancellation of all ANZAC Day commemorations in 2020 and the imposition of stringent
        restrictions in 2021.



                                                      1
    •   Prohibition of public attendance of Easter and Christmas church services in 2020, and the
        imposition of stringent restrictions in 2021.
    •   Destruction of small and middle businesses as a result of lockdowns while large corporations
        thrived.
    •       Arbitrary designation of services as 'essential' versus 'non-essential'
    •   False information given concerning the safety and efficacy of an experimental modified RNA
        injectable product.
    •       Misrepresentation of increasing reports of severe adverse reactions as 'rare' or 'mild'.
    •   Failure to financially compensate and support people suffering from severe adverse
        reactions.
    •   Failure to condemn the weaponization of the 'vaccine' as a mandatory measure used to
        discriminate against people unwilling to give their informed consent to having their bodily
        sovereignty violated.
    •   Deployment of federal police to shoot, assault, harass, and arrest members of the public on
        criminal charges relating to gathering in public or not wearing a mask.
    •   Apathy regarding investigating the increase in excess all-cause mortality since the roll-out of
        the modified RNA injectable product.
    •   Refusal to release anonymised record-level data for analysis of relationship between deaths,
        injuries, and COVID-19 injections.

It is imperative and ethically owing to the Australian public to have an independent investigation
conducted concerning the damage and injustice inflicted on millions of people in this country.

I have no hesitation in joining my voice to those of thousands of others demanding justice and
restitution to those who have suffered because of government ineptitude, indifference, or possibly
malfeasance.
