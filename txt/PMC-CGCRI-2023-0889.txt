Submission to COVID-19 Response Inquiry
Please consider the following actions and failures in Public Health Measures which needs to be
seriously looked into:

    1.      Unethical Vaccine Procurement and Secret Contracts

            •   Transparency Lapses: Potential instances of opacity and lack of accountability in
                vaccine procurement deals. Investigate the financial incentives or potential benefits
                received / offered to individual state leaders for procuring vaccine deals.

            •   Influence of Corporations: Explore potential corporate interests affecting
                procurement decisions. Were the decisions made in the best interest of Australia
                and its citizens?

   2.       Mask Mandates

            •   Efficacy vs. Freedom: Discuss the balance between the effectiveness of mask
                mandates and individual liberties.

            •   Public Compliance and Backlash: Analyse public reactions and the societal impacts
                of these mandates.

   3.       Lockdowns

            •   Social and Economic Fallout: Detail the adverse effects of lockdowns on mental
                health, businesses, and communities.

            •   Government Response: Evaluate the effectiveness of government support during
                lockdown periods.

   4.       Vaccine Mandates

            •   Ethical Concerns: Examine the ethical implications of mandating vaccines and its
                effects on personal choice and violation of basic human rights.

            •   Legal Dimensions: Explore the legal basis and challenges surrounding vaccine
                mandates.

   5.    Official Misinformation and false statements in the Media Regarding Vaccine Transmission
         Blocking

            •   Media Responsibility: Critique instances where media failed to accurately represent
                vaccine capabilities.

            •   Impact on Public Trust: Discuss the repercussions of misleading information on
                vaccine efficacy.

   6.       Vaccine Injuries

            •   Acknowledgment and Support: Shed light on cases of vaccine-related adverse
                effects and deaths and the support available to affected individuals.

            •   Reporting and Transparency: Discuss the need for transparent reporting of vaccine-
                related injuries.
7.   Media Censorship and Silencing of Doctors

     •   Freedom of Speech: Discuss instances of censorship and its impact on the exchange
         of vital information.

     •   Medical Expertise Suppression: Highlight cases where medical professionals were
         stifled for sharing dissenting opinions.

8.   Role of AHPRA and ATAGI in Censorship and Oppression of Doctors

     •   Regulatory Oversight: Evaluate the role and responsibility of organisations like
         AHPRA and ATAGI in managing medical discourse.

     •   Professional Ethics vs. Regulation: Discuss the balance between regulatory control
         and professional freedom.

9.   Appalling Treatment of Victims

     •   Humanitarian Approach: Advocate for better support systems for victims of adverse
         vaccine effects and their families.

     •   Justice and Accountability: Address the need for accountability and fair treatment of
         those affected. Consider appropriate action legal or otherwise on individuals and
         corporations whose policies and decisions directly resulted in loss of life, significant
         injuries (mentally and physically) and livelihoods and wellbeing impacted on the
         Australian population.
