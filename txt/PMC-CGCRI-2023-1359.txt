Assuming covid was a genuine deadly risk (it wasn't, it had a 99.7% recovery rate),
AND assuming the unjabbed were substantially more likely to spread or suffer from
the disease (they weren't), then instead of jab mandates resulting in loss of
employment (no jab no job) they could have required working from home (where
possible), or they could have stood people down with pay or let them take their
accrued leave (if they wanted to). There was never a need to sack anyone for either
exercising their right to free and informed consent, or for exercising their right to
medical privacy.

The federal government could have responded to put a stop to the wholly unethical
and unnecessary jab mandates and their devastating consequences on workers by
voting in favour of amending various laws to protect the workers (in fact several
proposals were put fourth in 2021 and 2022 by One Nation, Craig Kelly and others for
this purpose, however both Labor (shamefully) and LNP voted together against those
proposals).

Furthermore, the federal government could have not directly enabled the
enforcement of jab mandates if they had declined sharing certain data with the
states and they could have not created the covid 19 digital certificates (or jab
passes).
