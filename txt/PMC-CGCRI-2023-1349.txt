Commonwealth Government
Covid 19 Response Inquiry



To Whom it may concern,

I am writing to complain about the response measures employed during the recent Sars
Cov 2 outbreak. On the face of it, I welcome the government's commitment to examining
aspects of the COVID response such as governance, health response measures and financial,
community and international policy support. However, the decision to exclude actions taken
unilaterally by state and territory governments means many key aspects of Australia's response
will go unexamined. Australia is a federation and needs an inquiry that reflects this.
The terms of reference in this independent inquiry do not fully encapsulate all issues and
consequences and therefore there should be a royal commission so that meaningful
lessons can be learnt by all stakeholders. Lockdowns, border closures, school closures, mask
mandates and many other aspects were the domain of state and territory governments and to
not examine these as part of the inquiry means it will be harder for us to improve our response
for future pandemics.
The lack of a stated focus on how Australia's COVID response impacted on the human rights of
people is also concerning.
The policy decisions taken by all governments - as well as the implementation of those
decisions - had significant human rights implications for people here in Australia and overseas.
These may end up being considered by the inquiry but not having human rights explicitly part of
the key terms of reference is disappointing. We need to ensure the rights and freedoms that were
lost during the pandemic are better protected into the future and we need to ensure the human
cost of the pandemic is properly understood so our emergency responses in the future don't
leave people or their rights behind.

Politicians and their government departments did not;
             • Act on the best available advice,
             • Consider the long term consequences of their actions,
             • Have Australia's best interests in mind,
             • Act according to the Australian Federal Constitution.



Australian politicians, bureaucrats and government departments did;
           • Cause unnecessary harm to the Australian public,
           • Alienate and unnecessarily isolate people from their communities,
             • Waste taxpayer money,
             • Overspend on experimental medical interventions,
             • Cause people to lose their careers.



People that spoke against the state sponsored rhetoric and propaganda were shamed and
censored. The majority of what those people exclaimed has turned out to be true;
          • Only the elderly and weak should be shielded from exposure to the virus.
          • Herd immunity is the most effective way to deal with viruses.
          • It is likely that the outbreak originated from a laboratory in Wuhan China.
          • There are existing treatments (vitamin D, Ivermectin, etc) to treat symptoms.
          • Experimental medical interventions are not as effective as first claimed.
          • Experimental interventions do not stop transmission.
          • The experimental interventions tested were not the same as those
              distributed to the community.
          • Viruses can not be eliminated from society by way of injections.
          • Children are less likely to be infected and should remain in classrooms.
          • Sweden stayed open and they did just fine.
          • There was a massive wealth transfer to the billionaire class.
          • Mainstream media limits its content to suit government narratives.
          • Mask wearing is ineffective.
          • Those in positions of authority are abusing powers.



What transpired over the last four years can not be permitted to happen again,
whatsoever. The effects of this mismanagement are still being felt by the community
today.

Sincerely,



Hardy Grombach
