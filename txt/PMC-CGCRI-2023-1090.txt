THE FIRST DUTY OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE

Australia has been spared from the direst effects of Covidl9 which many other countries
have experienced.
We are grateful for the actions of our Government which have facilitated this outcome.

We are now moving into new Territory with the introduction of Pfizer and Moderna and
Astrazeneca Vaccines to inoculate our citizens.

When the first images of Covidl9 effects came onto our screens, people were terrified,
countries were terrified, Governments and International Organisations were also terrified.

Panic needs prompt action from Governments to address the situation, and even with the
best intentions, some unwise decisions have been implemented to maintain the threats to
the common good.

We now have comprehensive data, from the experiences of Covid 19 in 2020, to ensure that
the decisions we implement now are for the common good.

Governments and their Departments are made up of human beings, and so are liable to
make mistakes.

We need as a country, to examine all the data we now have available to recognise that
errors can be made, and to implement the wisest way forward.

Immunologists, Virologists, Biosecurity Specialists, and many other Medical Experts are
sounding grave warnings about the inoculations we are promoting. We need to listen to
and assess their advice.

Very many of our own Health Professionals are immune comprised and are voicing their
own concerns. These people are essential for the smooth operation of our Hospitals and
Clinics, and the warnings are being sounded particularly for those whose immune systems
are jeopardised.

The freedom of our people to choose to be inoculated or choose not to be inoculated is an
inalienable right and needs to be protected by our Governments.

Those choosing not to be inoculated must not suffer any form of discrimination or coercion
for exercising this right.
