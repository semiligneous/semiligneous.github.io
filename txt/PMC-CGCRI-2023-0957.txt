When the so-called Pandemic hit, we were travelling interstate with our family, looking to move
back to theafter many years away in^H, only to find we were completely priced
out of the market due to the governments negligence to disconnect the rental prices from the
ridiculous housing price increases.

The Government closed border, public toilets, campgrounds, motels, and other public areas,
meaning that we had to call around and try and find places to stay...we ended up sleeping in a
friends garage on the floor in 38 degree weather with no air con on our son's birthday. Prison would
have been better.

All of our possessions were back in^Hin storage. After a couple of months we finally were able to
cross back over, but were forced into isolation (at our expense) for two weeks in an AirBnB.

We then had to stay there for another 8 months while trying to find alternative accomodation.

We were preparing to meet my          Grandfather in        for his       Birthday in 2021, but were
not allowed out of the country. He had been waiting for 5 years to see us since our last visit.

He died 6 months later after being given the Covid Vaccine, he was completely well and fit before
that.

We were not allowed to leave the country again for his funeral which had over 1000 people attend,
as he used to be^^^^^|of the city.

We were suddenly no longer allowed in Restaurants that we frequented every week, and could not
take our children out to dinner for their birthdays.

All of these things, we consider criminal acts. Completely unforgivable.

As such we are leaving this country, after living here since 1975,1 no longer call Australia home.

You should all be ashamed of the state of this pathetic,island.
