This is a submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry.
I am a registered nurse, an^wa^ire^n^^^B202^rom my nursing position at
                 Hospital                     due to not receiving the Covid-
19 booster as per the government mandate. This is despite there being no legal obligation
on the hospital to fire me - the rules explicitly stated that they had to only prevent me
from attending work, unless I was needed for an emergency situation. Despite me trying
to explain this to them and asking them not to fire me, they still did. A few weeks later
there was a Covid outbreak at an attached aged care centre, where they needed extra staff,
that I could have helped at if I had not been fired. This was also in^^^H2022 when it
was already clear that the vaccines did not significantly stop transmission of Covid-19, so
enforcing it in the name of patients’ safety made no sense.
Over the last couple of years we have seen the deterioration in Victoria’s health services,
with staff shortages, ambulance ramping and increased wait times all having significant
effects on health outcomes for Victorians. I believe the sacking of many health care
workers like myself had no small role to play in this, though of course it does not explain
all of it.
Being fired also had an impact on myself and my family financially and in other ways,
and made me realize how little respect the Victorian government had for our human
rights, including the right to free and informed consent to medical treatment. Being told
that your ability to earn a living will be taken away if you do not comply with such a
measure definitely makes it impossible to give informed consent.
Thank you for reading my submission.
