               Good
               Ancestors
               Policy



Good Ancestors Policy is on Australian charity working to improve policy via rigorous and
evidence-based proposals that could have a big impact on the future. We are proud to have helped
coordinate Australians for Pandemic Prevention and support the content of their submission.

We think this Inquiry will lead to the most positive outcomes for Australians if it focuses on the future.
Australia needs to learn the lessons of COVID-19, but also needs to not "over-learn" those lessons. While
some things might be the same, others are likely to be different.

Overall, we assess that the evidence justifies substantial investment in pandemic prevention - both to
reduce the risk of novel pathogens emerging and to reduce the risk that any outbreak escalates into a
pandemic. Australia's approach should factor in all potential causes of a pandemic: this requires
robust implementation of proven approaches, as well as urgent implementation of new and emerging
technologies. Spending on mitigations should be commensurate with risk. Currently, there is substantial
underinvestment in pandemic prevention when compared to other, less consequential, disasters.1 Even
conservative estimates that don't account for promising new technologies or co-benefits suggest that
every dollar spent on zoonotic pandemic prevention alone saves $20 in harm.2

We recommend:
1.      The CDC should design and operate practical programs to reduce the risk of zoonoses.23
     1.1.   Work with states and territories to update biosecurity strategies to identify and implement
            measures to prevent transmission at the human-wildlife-livestock interface.4-7
     1.2.   The CDC, the Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security, and the Ambassador for Global Health
            should protect Australians by increasing efforts to support other countries in combating the
            risks of novel pathogens emerging in their jurisdiction.
     1.3.   Australia should consider including requirements about minimum standards of pandemic
            prevention in free trade agreements. For instance, if a free trade deal relates to animal
            products, the deal should set minimum zoonoses prevention standards for all parties.
2.      Early detection could transform the trajectory of future pandemics. The CDC should develop a
        strategy for an early novel pathogen detection system8 9 that harnesses emerging surveillance
        technologies, including metagenomics and CRISPR-based diagnostics.10-12
3.      Reliably clean indoor air must be normalised.13-15 In addition to improving standards for
        filtration and ventilation,16 the Inquiry should recommend that research funding be directed t
        resolving outstanding questions relating to UV germicidal irradiation, including far-UVC.17
        These technologies must be deployed before the next pandemic pathogen emerges
4.      While zoonoses have been the leading cause of pandemics historically, evidence suggests that
        the next pandemic is most likely to leak from a lab or be intentionally engineered.18 This has
        profound implications for how we must prevent and prepare for pandemics. The CDC should be
        tasked with assessing and controlling the risk of emerging biotechnologies and encouraging



                                                                                                    1
                                                                                                                g

       safer practices domestically and globally.19-22 It is unacceptable that the Office of the Gene
       Technology Regulator has not inspected any Australian PC4 labs for over 2 years.23
5.     Across all of its work, the Inquiry should consider the possibility of pandemics worse than
       COVID-19 and how suitable its recommendations are in those contexts. Specifically:
     5.1.   Workforce shortages and absenteeism could endanger the operation of critical
            infrastructure, including electricity.24 Addressing this will require critical infrastructure
            operators to have robust pandemic planning, including PRE that realistically allows their
            employees to perform critical functions during a catastrophic pandemic.25
     5.2.   Government should develop and exercise national plans that cover a range of pandemic
            scenarios, including worst-case scenarios. To ensure the plans are robust and build public
            confidence, the plans should be made public and exercised regularly with civil society and
            industry participants. The plans should cover:
             5.2.1. The emergence of a novel pathogen in Australia with the goal of identifying,
                   containing and eliminating it before a pandemic occurs.
             5.2.2. A "wildfire" pandemic that is more transmissible and has higher lethality than
                   COVID-19.25
             5.2.3. A"'stealth" pandemic that is more transmissible as COVID-19, and has presentation
                   or harmful effects that may manifest significantly after infection e.g. similar to HIV or
                   Human T-lymphotropic virus.25

Given the page restriction, this focuses on far-UVC and the implications of worse pandemics. We would
welcome further opportunities to engage with the Inquiry.

Improving Indoor Air Quality
Improving Indoor Air Quality (lAQ) to reduce pathogen transmission would slow the initial spread of a
pathogen and allow more time for response - including efforts to contain and eliminate a pathogen
before a pandemic begins. Consistent with the recommendations of "Sick and tired: Casting a long
shadow",13 we recommend that the CDC lead an update of minimum performance requirements
across the states and territories for IAQ to include infection prevention and incorporate the Lancet
COVID-19 Commission Task Force's Proposed Non-infectious Air Delivery Rates (nadr).16 This should
include a mandated minimum standard for IAQ in new high-risk and public spaces and subsidising the
cost of IAQ upgrades where necessary, including existing high-risk locations.

An uplift of IAQ will require a mix of technology. We assess that germicidal irradiation using ultraviolet C
(UVC) light is particularly promising for a range of reasons:
 • UVC light, a form of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths between 200nm and 280nm,
       deactivates pathogens by damaging their DNA or RNA.
 • Upper-room UVC (~254nm) emitters are installed horizontally near the ceiling to
       deactivate microorganisms that circulate towards the ceiling.
 • Far-UVC (207 to 222 nm) light fixtures are installed to shine down on rooms and provide
       continuous disinfection. This could reduce short-distance transmission and surface




                                                                                                            2
                                                                                                         g

    transmission, unlike other ventilation and filtration methods. Far-UVC could be particularly
    impactful in situations like hospitals, restaurants, classrooms or places of worship.
 • While far-UVC is not immediately ready for commercialisation, research shows that it is
    safe for eyes and skin,17,26,27 and effective at deactivating pathogens,28 including in the air.29
 • While work is required to drive down costs, it's unlikely that there are significant technical
    hurdles that would make far-UVC inherently impractical to commercialise.
 • The combination of these features means that far-UVC can achieve many of the same
    health benefits that mask-use would achieve in the general population but without
    requiring individual behaviour change, making it a much more tractable public health
    measure for reducing airborne pathogen transmission.

Combined, these points mean that far-UVC is ideally placed for government support to transition it
from a promising nascent technology to a scalable product that is ready for commercialisation. For
these reasons, a key element of delivering recommendation 3 should be funding appropriate bodies -
like the NHMRC, Thrive via ARC funding, or a new Cooperative Research Centre - to strategically
accelerate the technology for inclusion in national IAQ standards.

Preparing for worse pandemics
The core function of this Inquiry should be readying Australia for the next pandemic. However,
pandemic characteristics are growing harder to predict. The Geneva Centre for Security Policy
assesses that lab leaks have already overtaken natural spillover as the most likely cause of the next
pandemic.25 Progress in biotechnology and Al may mean this gap will widen and the risk of nefarious
actors will grow.19-22'30 These potential differences need to inform our response - we can't fight the last
war.

While COVID-19 caused workforce shortages and supply chain interruptions, these were less severe
than if the virus was more lethal among the working-age population. In a catastrophic pandemic, the
worst consequences could come from cascading and compounding effects. Worker absence could
leave critical infrastructure understaffed. Given the constant need for human intervention in power
generation and distribution, the national grid and other critical infrastructure could rapidly collapse.31 A
grid collapse causing cascading infrastructure failure could rapidly make cities uninhabitable.

Any recommendations produced by the Inquiry, including regarding PPE stockpiles, should be mindful
of pressures on critical infrastructure from a pandemic more lethal than COVID. This might include
ensuring there is sufficient and suitable PPE for critical infrastructure workers to confidently attend their
places of work during the height of a future pandemic.25

Of course, merely having equipment is not enough. Australia lacks a sufficiently diverse range of
regularly exercised national plans that would cover future pandemic scenarios i.e. "stealth" and
"wildfire".25 Given the value of immediate action, governance frameworks like the Australian
Government Crisis Management Framework or coordination tools, like the National Coordination
Mechanism or the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, are necessary but not sufficient.
Likewise, while specific plans like the Smallpox Emergency Management Plan are helpful, they do not
have the flexibility to cover a novel pathogen. For these reasons, Australia should develop a range of
plans and ensure they are regularly exercised on the tabletop and in person.
