Dear inquiry,

My submission underscores the significance of Australia directing its attention towards preventing
rather than just the preparation or ‘cure’ for future pandemics. Specifically, a focus on early
detection for “Disease X” and how that will have co-benefits for medical care, non-pandemic public
health and antimicrobial stewardship.

As a young Australian, COVID-19 was incredibly disruptive and I know my life would have looked
wildly different if the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak wasn’t allowed to become a pandemic. While
obviously this inquiry should explore all the ways the government can better help individuals and
communities in a future pandemic - even the best-managed pandemic will have terrible
consequences. That’s why I think the main goal should be pandemic prevention.

During the pandemic, I was in the process of finishing my degree majoring in Bioinformatics. It
completely befuddled me why this amazing technology existed and me - an undergraduate - was
using it but it couldn’t be adopted in the biggest health emergency of the century.

If we don’t have novel pathogen early detection, there will be a “Disease X” pandemic

Due to the exponential nature of case numbers in pandemics, time is a precious commodity. For
example, Measles is highly contagious, with an RO ranging from 12 to 18. This means that, on
average, one person with measles can infect 12 to 18 others in a fully susceptible population. If, on
average, each person with measles infects 15 others, after one generation, there would be 15
cases. After two generations, there would be 15 x 15 = 225 cases, three generations = 15 x 15 x
15 = 3,375 cases, four generations 50,625 cases, five generations 759,375 and so on.

86% or 95% respectively.1

We expect Wuhan to have done better but could Australia really have done better if we were in their
place? I would argue no simply because we have public health sequencing capacity materially similar to
theirs. If a pathogen emerges in Australia, we would undergo the same process. Doctors would see
case upon case with similar but undiagnosed symptoms until someone figured (in an adhoc way) that
it’s time to figure out what bug is causing all the illness. By that time there could be thousands of cases
in Australia and it is impossible to achieve zero community transmission.


Recommendations
    1.   Fund the Australian CDC to support a portfolio of diagnostics that for early detection
         and are rapidly scalable in a “Disease X” outbreak

Investing in the right mix of technologies for “Disease X” will be important. When the cost, time and
resource requirements for pathogen agnostic diagnostics come down, they may supplant pathogen
specific diagnostics entirely despite the transition costs. This is not only because of their ability to
identify a “Disease X’ but also the depth of clinical information that they can provide. Until then we
will need cheap, fast, simple preliminary diagnostics that rule out common illnesses to complement
pathogen agnostic diagnostics.

Pathogen agnostic diagnostics: Metagenomic sequencing
Currently, metagenomic sequencing (mNGS) is the only technology capability that can identify a
novel pathogen and its whole genome sequence. It works by sequencing all the DNA or RNA
fragments in a sample, and then assembling those fragments into larger ones. Large enough
fragments can be compared with existing databases of pathogens to identify if it is novel and what
its closest relative is. Knowing the exact DNA/RNA sequence of the genome is key to developing
vaccines, innovating medical countermeasures, and tracking new viral variants.

Pathogen specific diagnostics: Rapid multiplexed diagnostics
PCR was the main diagnostic technology throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and. It is the current
gold standard. However, other promising technologies have simpler sample preparation, use less
reagents, don't require heat cycling and can test many more samples for many more pathogens at
a time. The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense’s Apollo Program for Biodefense2 advocates for
massively multiplexed detection capabilities such as assays that use CRISPR-based microfluidics,3
semiconductor biochips,4 multiplexed PCR arrays5 and cross-hybridisation of highly conserved
sequence motifs.6

Crucially, some diagnostics like the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK assay7are programmable and
could be conceivably designed and tested in a week after the sequence of “Disease X” is known. It
also uses ubiquitous well plates that can be stockpiled. Most importantly it is also very
high-throughput, providing results for 5000 patient samples per day (24 h) based on a single liquid
handling robot. As with PCR,8 5 samples may be pooled together while infection prevalence is still
low to further increase testing throughput. This could mean 25,000 tests per day per robot.



    2. Deploy a “Threat Net”-like clinical mNGS architecture and routinely screen/diagnose
       a sample of ILI in the next 10 years

A pandemic pathogen is likely to be highly transmissible, capable of causing great death and
disruption to society, and unknown to the immune systems of current people. ILIs are often caused
by respiratory viruses which score highly on each of these criteria.9 Respiratory pathogens are
readily spread by close contact, aerosols in the air and droplets, making quarantine of sick people
difficult. Viruses also mutate faster than other pathogens, making it possible for them to evade the
immune system multiple times (e.g. contracting the delta strain of SARS-CoV-2 did not completely
protect against the omicron strain). This increases the costs to society in terms of both deaths and
disruption.

For these reasons, the next global pandemic is likely to also be a respiratory virus. Monitoring this
subset of diseases is therefore likely to cover a majority of future pandemic risk. Furthermore ILIs
may not be a self limiting cold virus but a more serious illness such as Meningitis, HIV or Strep
throat.10 Furthermore, an Australian study has shown that testing for flu does result in a decrease
of inappropriate antibiotic use, limiting the development of antimicrobial resistance and an increase
in appropriate antiviral use.11 Antimicrobial resistance is driven by overuse of antibiotics and it is
estimated that more than 10,000 Australians will die as a result of antimicrobial resistance between
2015 and 2050.12

Sharma et al (2023) Threat Net: A Metagenomic Surveillance, Health Security estimates that for
$400-800 million it would have a 95% change of detecting a novel SARS-CoV-2 like respiratory
pathogen after 10 emergency department presentations and 79 infections across the US.13

   3. Assign the CDC the responsibility and funding to design and implement a “Disease
      X” early detection system. Use this system in peace time for routine functions like
      data to improve the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)

Clinical metagenomics would only be part of a robust sequencing based public health system.
Depending on what sort of pathogen “Disease X” is, clinical metagenomics might not always be the
best to detect disease. The pre-print by Liu et al (2023) Quantitatively assessing early detection
strategies for mitigating COVID-19 and future pandemics14 estimates that hospital monitoring could
have detected COVID-19 -1000 cases earlier. However, wastewater surveillance could provide an
early warning for pandemics with long incubation periods like HIV and air travel monitoring does
best for diseases with low fecal shedding and when hospitalisation time and R0 is very high.
Accordingly there should be a national strategy to iterate towards an early detection system that
gets this mix of technologies and sampling methods right.

The other challenge with an early detection system is ensuring it is funded into perpetuity. Liang et
al (2023) Managing the Transition to Widespread Metagenomic Monitoring: Policy Considerations
for Future Biosurveillance, Health Security outlines a number of policy obstacles that need to be
overcome for a public health monitoring system with sequencing as it’s backbone to be successful
over the next decades. Therefore, I would expect that such a system needs to be useful not just in
a crisis but also in ‘peace-time’, therefore I would urge the CDC to make this system be useful for
providing data to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).

In conclusion, I think Australia can and needs to be ambitious with integrating genome sequencing
into the public health and diagnostic systems of health and medicine. We also need to figure out
how to fund this system into perpetuity as a detection system can’t bounce between being funded
and not funded at the whims of the political cycle. Simply, the costs of pandemics are too high, why
not spend a fraction of those costs on prevention. Just in the way that fires are inevitable but out of
control wildfires aren’t, novel pathogen outbreaks may be inevitable but outbreaks escalating into
pandemics aren’t. It’s time we take pandemic prevention as seriously as bushfire prevention.

Yours faithfully,
