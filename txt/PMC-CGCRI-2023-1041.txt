Submission to Covid Inquiry 14/12/2023

I am a taxpaying citizen of Australia and have run a business with my wife for
the last 34 years. We are law abiding, community minded people.
                                                    I have been moved to write
a submission because of the mishandling of the Covidl9 crisis by the federal
government.

In particular the banning of the use of existing alternative treatments for covid
19. Ivermectin was banned in Australia despite it being used successfully and
safely for decades. It was shown to be effective in the treatment of covid 19 by
practicing clinicians treating real patients with success. The discoverers of
Ivermectin were awarded the Nobel Prize for this breakthrough in 2015
(https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2015/press-release).

How can it then be banned by the Federal Government because it is unsafe?

I demand a full royal commission into the Federal Governments handling of
this event. The terms of reference need to allow the full investigation of lying,
collusion with drug companies, and the forcing of individuals to take unproven
and unsafe gene treatments called vaccines.

Yours truly
