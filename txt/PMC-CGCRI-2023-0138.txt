Given the excessively short period that this Response Inquiry process is open; there is not sufficient
time to complete a comprehensive submission.
I expect that my comments will be received as my submission. There is certainly sufficient evidence
so support a Royal Commission.


I request a Royal Commission for an investigation into:




- mask mandates
- lock downs
- vaccine mandates
- official misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block transmission
- vilification of the unvaccinated by the media
- vaccine injuries
- media censorship
- silencing of doctors                          _________
- the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship &                 doctors
- and, the poor treatment of victims of vaccine injuries
