I am disabled and immunocompromised from a                  transplant I undertook for^^H


The personal impact of the decisions made by National Cabinet has been not feeling safe
enough to even consider returning to work.

In my personal experience, COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments have been poorly
communicated by the government. The federal government needs to be providing
information to the public that is truthful, up to date and scientifically accurate. The Federal
Health department could improve Public Health messaging by actually acknowledging that
COVID-19 is a dangerous and disabling virus for all people, not just people in “vulnerable”
groups.

In my personal experience, the government’s policies regarding financial support during the
pandemic were sufficient during the first year but abysmal since then.

My feedback is that disabled and medically vulnerable people have experienced complete
social ostracization due to the pandemic and this could be addressed by the government at
least enforcing COVID-19 mandates such as masking policies and better air
purification/ventilation in medical facilities, supermarkets, shops, dentists and other places
where they must be able to access to survive.

My personal experience of the pandemic inequities faced by Australians due to being
immunocompromised and disabled has been alienating and traumatising and I call on the
government to respond with compassion and community focused solutions.

Australia would be better prepared for current and future pandemics if the government would
invest in Clean Air in schools, masks in healthcare, better access to antivirals and timely
updated vaccines. There is a gap in Australia’s response in all things mentioned and there is
an opportunity to rectify that.
