The Affect of the Vaccination Mandate on my work situation and life.




I have joined the Red union because I felt that this union could help me. With guidance from the
Red union I was able to ask my principal for a risk assessment and I it was very nice of her to give me
feedback but it wasn't sufficient enough for myself. As for^^^^^^^^^^^^Hwas getting text
messages to remind me to fill out the vaccine survey at the end of 2021 through to start pf January
2022. I was getting emails and texts to remind me to fill out the survey or I would face termination
on the 7th January. I felt this coercion was not warranted and I believed having a choice to keep
myself healthy by being responsible for how I approach my health for my own body was what was
needed in this instance.
             I wish to place an injection into my body that was still at the experimental stage which
may have interfered                                                              no.

The way the mandating had impacted my family during 2022 year was that I didn't return to work
and had to take my SICK LEAVE and LONG SERVICE LEAVE. I was not able to access CENTRELINK after
the leave ran out and had to struggle on the funds that I received, ^^^^^^fhelped me through
this time.

My health had suffered due to the mandates by presenting as chronic anxiety and depression and
having to get prescription drugs and therapy to help cope with day to day living. I was seeing a
therapist once every two weeks and she was helpful in giving me useful tools to help me get through
this tumultuous time. The insecurity of not having a job that I thought I would have for at least
another fifteen years had the same physical and mental effects on my body as my divorce did twelve
years before. As the time drew nearer to the vaccine status and possible termination of my job, I
had physical symptoms of stress in the form of problems with my digestive diseases. This caused me
to be weak and bed ridden for days sometimes.                      was quite angry at me for not
getting the injection as she was not able to do things socially and we didn't have the money to do
the stuff she wanted to do wit hher friends.             did not know what I am going through
as I did not tell her.^^^^^^H did not want me to get the injection as he was worried for my
health.                                                                                   2022.
