I'm



Starting in 2022, My company suffered financial loss due to the government mandate's

Of no jab no entry.

A number of corporations, mainly                              Who were already operating

Non contact sites and still do so to this day enforced the mandates, this site restriction has

caused financial loss to my company. Through the loss of

                       which to this day I have not been able to recoup.



I believe the mis information and fear campaign the government ran was unlawful

and unjust. Even after numerous phone calls and emails with Covid officers of these

corporations I was still denied access. Smaller companies and corporations operating in the

same industry, also ran non contact sites which I was allowed access to and to my

knowledge there was no transmission of any virus.
