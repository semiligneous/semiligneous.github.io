My name i:                 I am a registered nurse who retired early due to the COVIC
vaccine mandates. I was highly esteemed and recognised and acknowledged in the
workplace as an exceptional nurse.

Early Research into COVID-19 Vaccine Raised Concerns
In my early research regarding COVID-19 vaccination I determined from the Swiss
government health site that there was at least a short-term negative impact of the COVID-
19 vaccine on one's immune system. Forthose with underlying immune related conditions
(either past or present) this was concerning, especially when there are some well-known
ways of supporting the immune system. These concerns were ignored and not addressed in
the Australian response. Anecdotally these concerns are now being confirmed, with some
suggestion as to the way the vaccine may be associated with the immune response.

Royql Commission
I request that the government move beyond a COVID-19 Response Inquiry to a full Royql
Commission for a proper investigation into; vaccine procurement and confidential contracts;
financial incentives for those promoting the vaccines, PCR testing and accuracy, testing and
approval of vaccines, mask and vaccine mandates, lock downs, media censorship, regulators
roles in eroding the doctor-patient relationship and professionals ability to practise
according to the Hippocratic oath, informed consent, correct approval of gene-based
treatments, reporting of injuries, compensation, policing, excess deaths, financial impact on
businesses and the erosion of human rights and freedom of choice for medical treatments.

Only Vaccination; No Attention to Risk Reduction
The COVID-19 response focused only on vaccination. Preventive health measures were not
implemented, supported nor included in public messaging. There was a lack of education
regarding simple, easy cost-effective early interventions. There was no focus on or
prioritisation of any preventive measures that could reduce morbidity of COVID-19, nor was
there any attention to early intervention measures. In fact, there was censorship and
suppression of discussion around these items. It is imperative in future that the public
health messaging should include informing the public of ways to protect their health as well
as lifestyle modifications that can be implemented to reduce morbidity should someone
become infected with the disease of concern. For example:

    1. Vitamin D supplementation is known to assist immune response to many illnesses
        and COVID-19 is no exception.

    2. Dietary intake and nutritional status affects one's health and immune status.

   3.   The benefit of sunlight and fresh air in reducing transmissibility of diseases is well
        know but there was no encouragement for people to avail themselves of this natural
        resource, in fact in some areas people's ability to access the outdoors was limited.

    4. The use of hydrotherapy in activating the immune system and decreasing the
        severity of COVID-19 infections early in the course of disease with the potential to
        reduce hospitalisations.

Ineffective Response (Masking)
An early mainstay of the health response involved utilisation of personal protective
equipment in workplaces and utilisation of masking throughout society. Masking is
ineffective for any aerosol transmissible disease. Aerosols stay suspended for days to weeks
(vs minutes for droplets), readily pass through gaps around the masks, and can reach deep
into the lungs.

Future health responses should only be effective evidence-based practices.

Australian Research of New Products About to be Implemented is Required
It is imperative that Australia critically and thoroughly examine any company data and
supporting studies for any new product rather than relying on other countries to do this.
This is usually the situation so why was the vaccine treated differently to any other product
being introduced into Australia? An examination of Pfizer documents would have revealed
that good clinical practice was not followed in their research; the study was unblinded, the
study duration was too short to reveal long-term adverse effects, there was no benefit in
the absolute risk reduction (the criteria for determining benefit from a drug) and amongst
other issues there were groups excluded from the study resulting in unknown impacts on
these groups (e.g. elderly, pregnant women and children).

Workforce Issues, treatment of employees and equity
We are still hearing reports of workforce shortages in medical areas. Yet despite the
dropping of mandates employees who did not receive the vaccine are not being reÂ­
employed. Instead, up until the day prior to mandates being relinquished these employees
were subject to disciplinary action and dismissal from the workplace - all for refusing a
vaccine that has been shown to be ineffective, unsafe and that currently negatively impacts
the immune system and is associated with more adverse events than all other vaccines
combined.

It is inequitable for those making the laws to be exempt from following them i.e. politicians
not required to be vaccinated.

Informed Consent and Mandates
Informed consent requires explanation of the risks and benefits of a procedure, risks and
benefits of alternative options, risks and benefits of not having the procedure, and must be
voluntary, (i.e. free from manipulation by or undue influence from family, medical staff or
other social coercive influences). With vaccine mandates this process was ignored;
alternative treatments were not considered and anyone whose employment was
threatened with subsequent inability to provide for their family was unable to give
voluntary consent - they were effectively threatened by the mandates.

https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-
statement-on-mandatory-vaccination-of-all-workers-in-health-ca re-settings

Some workers who were mandated to receive the vaccine had concerns regarding the
impact the vaccine would have on their health, concerns regarding components of the
vaccine, concerns surrounding the safety of the vaccine and other concerns. These workers
were expected to communicate with their employer within given timeframes but despite
submitting their concerns and requesting a response from their employer their requests
were ignored. The voiced concerns of any professional or public person should be
thoroughly investigated and they should receive timely responses to their query/concern.

Finally it is imperative
a) that all citizens and employees are free to refuse consent to a medical procedure without
redress or penalty,
b) that health professionals who have concerns are free to express their concerns and raise
alarms - if those who saw birth defects due to thalidomide were unable to raise the alarm
how much longer would it have taken to identify and prevent this issue from continuing,
c) medicine is able to practice freely - we are all different individuals, and one treatment
does not suit everyone; without the ability to try different ways of managing a condition the
best treatment is not found, and
d) the doctor patient relationship needs to be restored - medicine should be a dialogue
between doctor and patient with the freedom to express all benefits AND disadvantages of
a treatment otherwise trust in medicine will never return.
