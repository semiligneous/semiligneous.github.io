Dear PM and Cabinet Members.

I write as a very concerned Australian citizen.

I request that there be a full, open, honest and wide-ranging inquiry via a royal commission, into the impact of the
Australian and state government responses to the Covid vaccine pandemic. This inquiry must be undertaken by
independent experts from a wide field of experience.

This is urgently needed.
This needs to include:

    •          the indemnity given to pharmaceutical companies re the cv vaccine
    •          the fact that each vaccine did not undergo standard long-term clinical trial data outcomes
    •          the true number of deaths as a result of the Covid Vaccine (TGA only publicly admits to 14 deaths, but
         this is not the true number in their own database)
    •          the true number of vax injuries
    •          statistics of different vax injuries
    •          vaccine mandates
    •    the silencing of doctors and the fear of punishment and reprisal through censorship and oppression by
         both AHPRA and ATAGI
    •          media censorship
    •          blackmailing of the population through forced vaccines to keep their jobs
    •          the consequences of lockdowns
    •          the closing of state borders
    •          the secret national cabinet meetings
    •          the impact on mental health across society
    •    the ongoing impact of forced school closures on student's mental health and the documented
         deteriorating academic performance
    •          the constant fear messaging and pressure by all government departments throughout the pandemic

Why my concern?

    •         I personally know many people who have been permanently injured by the C-vaccines
    •         I personally know of previously healthy people who have serious health issues that appeared suddenly
         after the C-vaccine was given
    •    This includes serious ongoing heart issues; lung issues; breast cancer; prostate cancer; melanomas and
         debilitating neurological disorders etc
    •         I personally know of many people whose employment was unacceptably terminated by their employer
    •         I personally know of people who were not reinstated once the mandates were lifted, such was the
         stigma associated with not being vaxxed
    •         I hear many stories similar to this in talking to family and friends

I see the consequences of all the above-

    •    the devastation of the economy due to shut down of businesses and resulting permanent closure of
         many businesses
    •         the subsequent loss of jobs, productivity and businesses, still happening post pandemic today
    •         the loss of jobs leading to loss of income, loss of businesses and loss of homes
    •         the resultant increased homeless-ness across Australia

We now have:

    •         a crisis in our health systems through lack of sufficientstaff because the mandatesforced many out
    •         a crisis in our policing numbers for the same reason
    •         a crisis in the education system for the same reason
    •         a crisis seen in increased ambulance ramping at our hospitals asaresultof reducedstaff
    •    the above crises as a consequence of termination of employment and failure to reinstate public
         servants
    •         a crisis of increased homeless-ness
    •         a coming crisis in the downturn in our economy

A full, open, honest and wide-ranging inquiry is need by independent experts to address these very serious
issues of mis-management by the federal and state governments, during the pandemic.

This is urgently needed.

Failure to do this may indicate a serious cover-up.

Yours sincerely
