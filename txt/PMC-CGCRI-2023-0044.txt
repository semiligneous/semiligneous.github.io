Dear Covid 19 Response Enquiry,

The following submission is in regard to the consequences and effects the Australian Federal and
State Governments covid 19 response decisions had, and continue to have, on myself and my wife.

At the beginning           My wife and I had commenced a years sabbatical during which we
were travelling via^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^fwith a return date planned for^^^^^^|

The Australian Governments advice against travel was issued after our departure.

In                  and located in^^^^^A/e were plunged into lockdown.
At the start of^^J:he^Bgovernment lifted some of its travel bans and we were free to travel in
^^^|which we undertook.

                it became apparent to us that the Australian government's decision, of
indeterminable length, to drastically limit flights into the country, along with its uncompromising
hotel quarantine policy, was severely restricting travel and effectively acting as a financial border
closure to those Australians overseas getting home. It was at this point in late                that we
began to attempt to book a flight home to Australia. After many attempts, with many flight changes
and with increased costs, including the change of our destination from our home airport of
^^^^^|we successfully returned to Australia in

Like tens of thousands of others, we experienced the horror of hotel quarantine. The forced denial of
our basic human rights, our liberty and freedom, even access to fresh air was what we were greeted
with on our home soil. We had no choice but to comply and were effectively coerced under the
watchful eyes of members of the^^Hpolice, government officials and armed forces into a
transaction (Quarantine fees, provision of care -biopsychoscoial medical, food, drink, fresh air,
warmth and shelter, with a nebulous body (State government health department or hotel or federal
government - the legal framework remains entirely dubious as to who holds the ownership of cost
and responsibility and has not been tested in court to my knowledge)).

During the quarantine period we received brief, poorly delivered and inconsistent check in phone
calls (Not every day) to the hotel room. We did not leave the room for 14 days and during this period
did not have access to fresh air (the windows did not open)




      however the experience and subsequent ill qualified support from the 'nurse' on the phone
illustrated too me that no one was immune to the mental health impact of having ones basic human
rights removed in such a manner, and that there would be many who were experiencing this at a
much higher level of acuteness causing a genuine risk to life.

To add insult to injury, I was charged $1000 and my wife $3000 for the privilege of this incarceration,
the unethical and immoral nature of a cost as well as the disparity in costs escapes my reasoning.

Subsequent to this experience in
                                          wife was again coerced into signing a document stating
that she would be prepared to pay for hotel quarantine in her future return to Australia, that she
would not return within three months, and that without this signed acknowledgement, a permission
to fly would not be granted.
My wife arrived

When my wife did return tc^^^^^|Australia                        she was again incarcerated in hotel
quarantine, but this time with the additional trauma of         alone in isolation.
Despite requests to quarantine at home,
                                request was denied.

The argument must be made that; there is no reasonable moral justification for a state or
government to implement and charge a member of the public a cost for a measure the government
has imposed in this regard, and which denies basic human rights, to purportedly be the best and only
measure available to protect the population at large from harm, and that results in a detrimental
physical and / or mental impact on the individual.

We (My wife and I) continue to be harassed and pursued for payment by the authorities of
though not currently (at the time of writing) b\^|for payment of the hotel quarantine, to which we
did not willingly and freely accept.
