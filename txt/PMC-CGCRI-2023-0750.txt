After the debacle of the Australian government's handling of 'Covid 19' we DEMAND a Royal
Commission to investigate the following:

    -   The contracts between the Australian government and the companies who supplied the
        Covid 19 injections.
    -       The ability of these injections preventing the transmission of the the virus.
    -   The survival rate of said virus of over 99% and the draconian measures that were put in place
        for something akin to the yearly flu.
    -   The silencing of medical professionals to utter any opinion contrary to the official stance of
        the government and AHPRA.
    -       The abuse of Human Rights to enforce mask mandates, social distancing and lockdowns
    -       The mandating of vaccines to receive health care and to attend workplaces
    -       The loss of jobs for those Australians who chose not to subject to these injections and who
        were also ostracized from society through the voices of the PM and the state premiers.
    -       The involvement of the WEF with the Australian government
    -       The excess deaths that coincide with the roll-out of the vaccine mandates.



The response to Covid 19 has fractured the nation. Rather than being the voices of reason, the State
and federal governments drove a wedge between the Australian people, pitting vaccinated against
unvaccinated, masked against unmasked. The Australian people have been beaten by those who
were supposed to look out for them; the police, the state and federal governments, ATAGI, AHPRA
and countless medical professionals who participated in injecting the experimental injections
knowingly and causing (and ignoring) the injuries cause by them. Australia is hurting. We need an
impartial inquiry into the Covid 19 response.
