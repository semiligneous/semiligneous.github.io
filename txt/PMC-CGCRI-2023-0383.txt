Submission for the COVID Inquiry from the Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet


To whom it may Concern.


I request a full Royal Commission for a proper investigation into:
   1.       Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts
   2.       Vaccine mandates
   3.       Vaccine injuries
   4.       Mask mandates and lock-downs
   5. Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to
        block infection and transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gas
        lighting of the injured
   6. The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on the undeniable
        harm of the vaccine and their action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical
        Profession.
