Health and Non Health Responses

Ordering citizens to be vaccinated with a vaccination that had not been tested over time was
a dictatorial move and one which was not welcomed by many citizens who enjoy the
freedom of the democracy that we live in here in Australia.

No-one knows the impact these vaccinations will have on the fertility of the children who
have been vaccinated. Vaccinations such as polio and tetnus were tested over a period of
time to bring to light any side effects of the vaccination. The same time period was not
applied to the Covid viruses. I for one, chose to lose my job rather than be injected with a
vaccination that needed several boosters and neither did it stop one from either getting the
virus or carrying the virus.
