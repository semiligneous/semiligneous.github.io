All governments did an absolute terrible job of handling covid 19 policies but as this relates to
federal government only I will only speak of this.
I think there should have been federal legislation put in to allow unrestricted movement between
states and local areas. While it was considered a dangerous virus for a small amount of time for
the fit and healthy it was proven to not be as shown in the age and health demographics of those
who died from the virus. The country would not be able to afford to hold up its citizens financially
like last time so there should be legislation put through to limit funding for a pandemic response in
terms of welfare and vaccines. The federal government also had a responsibility to make sure no
one was discriminated against when they approved the vaccine, especially since it was an
experimental vaccine. Time has shown that it was not effective and probably wasnâ€™t safe.
The government should be held to account for how many vaccines they secured as there were 5
years worth of vaccines secured if every person got vaccinated based on how many were secured
by the federal government.
