For a future response to pandemics, a Royal Commission needs to be conducted to properly
assess the issues that arose from the government response to Covid 19.

- the impact of lockdowns
- the compulsory vaccine mandates for an experimental vaccine
- the injuries from the vaccine
- the role of ATAGI in suppressing information regarding the vaccine dangers, and the
  procurement process
- the inability of the prescribed vaccination to prevent the spread of Covid 19.

A Royal Commission will prevent a whitewash of the issues, so that government can be better
informed in future decision making.
Truth telling should not be avoided by the Albanese government.
