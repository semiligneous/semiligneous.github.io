Submission: Australian Federal COVID-19 Response Inquiry


To the Review Panel,

If any lesson is to be drawn from the Federal Government’s Covid pandemic
management, it is that Australia should go back to its pre-COVID-19 pandemic
management plan (the AHMPPI).1 Under no circumstances should this Inquiry give
the green light to repeating the Government’s COVID-19 pandemic response tactics
in the next pandemic. It was an unmitigated failure.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian Government panicked and threw
wisdom, scientific method and ethics out the window. This was regrettable, and has
had devastating impacts on our economy and social fabric, as documented in
several independent reviews to date.2

Key points addressing terms of reference:

    1. The Federal Government failed to protect Australians from workplace
       discrimination by voting down the COVID-19 Vaccination Status (Prevention
       of Discrimination) Bill 2022 and the Fair Work Amendment (Prohibiting
       COVID-19 Vaccine Discrimination) Bill 2023.3 The Government’s failure to
       protect its citizens from workplace discrimination in the form of vaccine
       mandates caused undue stress, loss of income, degraded mental health, and
       economic strain as some able Australians were forced into unemployment for
       months or years. As mandates are still in place in some industries, this failure
       is ongoing.

    2. The Federal Government’s pandemic response spending, especially on
       COVID-19 treatments, has been extraordinarily wasteful. Of the first 255
       million vaccine doses purchased, it was reported that only 60 million were
       used, with more than half set to expire and be dumped, to the estimated value
       of approximately $3 billion.4 To date, the Government has spent more than

        $18 billion on COVID-19 treatments, many of which have expired unused.5
        The Government has never offered a coherent reason for purchasing such a
        vast supply of vaccine doses that could never have been used before expiry.
        This is an unacceptable waste of public funds.

    3. The Federal Government blocked access to treatments for COVID-19 that
       had a body of evidence behind them and were relatively cheap. Blocking
       access to viable treatments is undemocratic and inhumane.6

    4. The Federal COVID-19 Vaccine Injury Compensation Scheme is too narrow,
       slow, and inadequate. Injured Australians say they feel “hung out to dry.” In
       the first 18 months of the scheme, only 5% of claims had been approved.7
       Such shameful treatment of our vaccine injured by the Federal Government,
       which failed to protect Australians from vaccine mandates imposed by the
       state governments, will only encourage vaccine hesitancy, because
       Australians know they are on their own if they get hurt by their vaccination.

    5. The Federal drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has
       no idea how many of the adverse events reported to its DAEN database are
       actually caused by the COVID-19 vaccines. Yet, the TGA maintains that the
       COVID-19 vaccines are safe. This is unacceptable. The TGA has failed in its
       regulatory duties, performing little to no follow up on reported injuries and
       deaths.8 Further, in some cases, the TGA has hidden reported child deaths
       from public view in order to manipulate public opinion on the COVID-19
       vaccine program.9 This is an egregious betrayal of public trust and will only
       undermine confidence in the TGA, the Department of Health, and Australia’s
       COVID-19 and National Immunisation Programs. The Federal Government
       should conduct a serious review of the TGAs practices, addressing its funding
       model and the potential conflicts posed.

    6. Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison made a mockery of the when he
       secretly appointed himself to five different ministries.10 The review should
       recommend that provisions be made to prevent Prime Ministers from

        exercising such abuse of power going forward.

    7. National cabinet meeting minutes should not be kept under lock and key. It is
       inappropriate that both Liberal and Labor governments have maintained
       secrecy around key pandemic decision-making that affected all Australians.11

    8. The Federal Government’s myopic obsession with vaccines at the expense of
       public health messaging and funding for major determinants of health put
       Australians’ lives at risk, and this continues to this day. Obesity and low
       Vitamin D are significant risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes, yet the
       Government has barely acknowledged this, let alone campaigned for healthy
       weight and improved Vitamin D levels in ‘combatting COVID-19.’12 Cynics
       might suggest that the Government’s lack of interest in low-cost solutions to
       COVID-19 is suggestive of its need to bolster commercial partnerships with
       vaccine manufacturers, such as its Moderna partnership in Melbourne.13 The
       Government’s future health responses should be built around what works, not
       what commercial partnerships can be leveraged from the response.

    9. The Government has provided no Cost Benefit Analysis for its pandemic
       response. Instead, Government representatives congratulate each other for
       achieving bureaucratic markers of success. Failure to assess the
       Government’s performance against real outcomes only serves to encourage a
       culture of ‘failing up’, which is unfortunately common in the Australian
       bureaucracy. Please consider making a thorough CBA part of the review
       process - and if not, why not?

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Rebekah Barnett
