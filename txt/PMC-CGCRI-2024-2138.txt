As a scientist we sometimes underestimate the power of the general public to make decisions based on
evidence based data presented daily for public health issues. It's unfortunate we stopped public data
availability on the government website to enable people to make an evidence based risk assessment on
where the cases are and the areas to avoid contraction of a public health issues.



The lesson's we're not learner and applied to avoid future epidemics.



Leaving this risk management to health professionals alone doesn't work and public health is everyone's
responsibility and are part of the solution.

Share the data so we can all make evidence based risk management decisions in an epidemic. Its a form
of good governance practices.
