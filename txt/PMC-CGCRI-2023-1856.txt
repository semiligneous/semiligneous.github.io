I wish to comment as a citizen that I never
conceived so many violations of
fundamental human rights to be possible
in a developed and progressive nation
such as ours. Notably:

 1. Freedom of movement (to enter and
 leave one's own country)
2. Right to informed consent in healthcare
(mandatory vaccinations with insufficient
trial data)
3. Freedom from discrimination -
government and media endorsement of
discrimination against the unvaccinated on
 no evidence of efficacy in controlling the
spread (as evidenced by infection rates in
 NSW, despite approximately 95%
vaccination rate) and
 licence given to private sector employers
to discriminate on medical grounds (no
jab, no job)
5. Freedom of speech - dissenting medical
professionals silenced
6. Freedom of association - separation
from
family and friends during lockdowns.

As an employer in the international
education sector, I witnessed depression,
anxiety and inability to function in the
workplace following the border closures
and resultant job losses in the industry.

As a friend and colleague , I witnessed
people suffering for months from the side
effects of vaccinations they were coerced
into.

As a daughter, I was unable to see or
assist my aged parents abroad for two
years.

The cost of the measures taken by the
Australian government to control the
spread of the virus is still being felt today
socially, economically, physically and
mentally.

It would make more sense to take steps to
protect and support the vulnerable (elderly
and immune compromised people) than to
bring the entire healthy and productive
population to a standstill for their
protection - what is a life worth without a
job and in isolation?

I would like to see a full investigation such
as a Royal Commission into the human
rights violations committed by our
government and an assurance that these
will never be repeated.

Thank you for reading.

Sincerely,
