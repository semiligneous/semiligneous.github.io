Dear Enquiry members

I would like to raise the issue of the broader health effects of the covid lockdowns.

When I caught Covid, I was staying with my wife's family, including m            brother-in-law. For
his safety, I was not merely confined to the house, but confined to my bedroom. This extreme
restriction caused me to suffer a suicidal mental breakdown, from which I still have not fully
recovered, over 18 months later.
I was partially harmed by the isolation requirement in place at the time, but also partly harmed by
the anxiety and panic that these policies induced in my in-laws family.

On a broader level, I recently read this scientific paper: 'A Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 Sequelae
and Immunity: Baseline Findings' by Sneller et al, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine
(available here: https://doi.org/10.7326/IVI21-4905).
One of the findings was that the only significant risk factors they could find for long Covid was that
were that the sufferer was female (P = 0.005) and self-reported history of anxiety disorder (P =
0.003). The Wall Street Journal reported on this finding (available here:
                                                       ) saying B                                    â– 



Based on this statistic, I conclude that the fear of the virus caused by government and media
messaging didn't merely have multitudinous unintended negative consequences as a side effect;
causing people to fear the virus had the direct consequence of literally making the virus worse.

My recommendation is that messaging about future health crises should focus on accuracy and avoid
fear-mongering language and imagery. Deliberately inducing fear causes more problems than it
solves, including harmful over-reactions, avoidable emotional damage to many, and in the case of
long Covid, a direct increase of severity.

Sincerely,

Daniel Smartt.
