Medicines Australia's Response to the Department of Prime
Minister and Cabinet's COVID-19 Response Inquiry
December 2023



Medicines Australia welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Department of Prime Minister and
Cabinet's COVID-19 Response Inquiry.

Medicines Australia leads the research-based medicines industry of Australia. Our members were
among the companies that discovered, developed, and manufactured the vaccines and treatments for
COVID-19. These vaccines and treatments are what have led Australia's public health response to be
one of the most successful globally,1 a response with which most Australians were satisfied.2

Learnings from Australia's COVID-19 pandemic response, as well as global responses, will help guide
and prepare us for future disease outbreaks. Medicines Australia and our members are keen to
continue working with the Government to ensure Australia's health and prosperity is protected. This
submission will highlight some key considerations for Government systems to anticipate, adapt, and
respond to pandemics more effectively. These include:

    •       Ensuring Government- Industry Coordination to Strengthen Medicines Supply Chains
    •       Investing in Chronic Conditions and Preventative Health Strategies
    •       Improving the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Process
    •       Thinking Globally and Strengthening International Partnerships.



Ensuring Government-Industry Coordination to Strengthen Medicines Supply Chains
The COVID-19 pandemic placed great pressure on pharmaceutical supply chains, with border closures
and freight delays. Coordination between Medicines Australia, the TGA, other medicines peak bodies,
and supply chain organisations, ensured the disruption of medicines supply was kept to a minimum
during the pandemic.

Medicines Australia was part of the TGA's Medicines Shortages Working Group3, which helped
coordinate and manage the supply and shortages of medicines. Additionally, Medicines Australia and
the Generic Biosimilar Medicines Association (GBMA) were granted ACCC Authorisation4 to permit
discussions that led to implementation of strategies that supported the continued supply of essential
medicines to Australians.

The collaboration and efficiency of industry and Government working together to ensure the supply
of essential medicines to Australia will be critical to managing the next pandemic.

Investing in Chronic Conditions and Preventative Health Strategies
People with pre-existing chronic conditions have greater risk of developing severe illness from COVID-
19. The proportion of deaths from COVID-19 among people with a chronic condition recorded was
85.2% in 2023.5 Nearly 50% of Australians live with a chronic condition.6 With over 28% of Australians
over 50 years of age7, this significant portion of the population had one of the highest risks for
developing serious illness from COVID-19.5 Further, people with chronic diseases were vulnerable to
the potential worsening of pre-existing conditions because of disruptions to their care.8

                                                                                                     through research
                                                                                   HUj LI cl I lei    and innovation




Reducing the number of Australians living with chronic conditions through preventative health will
make the population more resilient to face future health challenges. However, Australia only spends
1.8% of its total healthcare expenditure on preventative health compared to 2.9% in the US, 3.7% in
the UK, and 5.9% in Canada.9

The National Preventative Health Strategy10 outlines the importance of vaccines but underplays the
role of innovative medicines in preventative health. Investment into new medicines has been shown
to improve health outcomes. The greater number of medicines available on the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme (PBS), the better the health outcomes are for a condition.11

Proactive investment in preventative health such as vaccines and new medicines will help keep
Australians healthy and reduce the health impacts of future pandemics.

Improving the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Process
The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that approval processes for new medicines and vaccines can be
faster than it currently is. Once effective vaccines and treatments were available for COVID-19, the
Australian Government bypassed lengthy established HTA processes to approve and procure them. If
the standard processes were followed, COVID-19 vaccines would not have been available for at least
two years.12

As COVID-19 becomes endemic, attention to other potential threats of pandemic proportions such as
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) should be considered in the context of HTA. AMR has ascended the
international policy agenda as it is recognised by the WHO as one of the top ten public health threats
facing humanity.13

Despite this threat, HTA processes generally approach their assessment of antimicrobial agents from a
perspective that does not recognise many elements of value provided by antimicrobial agents apart
from immediate health gains.14 This narrow focus on immediate health gains is also true for vaccines,
where the health benefit is seen across a lifetime, and broader societal benefits such as herd immunity
are not considered.15

Improving HTA systems to be more efficient will incentivise innovator companies to bring their
treatments to Australia, and provide Australians faster access to new medicines. This efficiency should
not only occur during the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic. The Government's Health
Technology Assessment Policy and Methods Review16 currently underway is an opportunity to
establish more flexible pathways to provide faster access to new medicines and vaccines.

Greater access to medicines is intrinsically linked to pandemic preparedness as more innovative
medicines on the PBS results in better health outcomes11 and a healthier population that is more
resilient to future health threats.

Thinking Globally and Strengthening International Partnerships
Pandemics are global in nature, and therefore, Australia's outlook should also be global to ensure
both the health and economic security of the country. Trade and investment agreements with
international partners can foster innovation, technology, and skills transfer. These can enhance
Australia's global competitiveness to research, develop and manufacture new medicines and
vaccines.17 Trade investments and agreements can also help Australia's ability to withstand and
recover from pandemic supply chain shocks by ensuring equitable distribution of medicines.18

                                                                                                                             through research
                                                                                                        Australia            and innovation




Australia's public health communication response should support nations in making decisions based
on evidence, tailored to their unique contexts. Australia's decision to caution against certain vaccines
for certain age groups affected vaccine confidence in the region.19

Areas with high infection rates, and lower vaccination rates, such as lower income countries, can
increase the chances of new virus strains emerging.20 Australia is well-positioned to support regional
health security and to share clinical and public health expertise across the Western Pacific region,
protecting our neighbours as well as ourselves.16

Pandemics can force societies to face major existential threats. It is during these times that it is more
important than ever for all countries to embrace regional and global solidarity.



The inquiry into Australia's COVID-19 response is an important step to recognise our achievements in
managing the pandemic and where there can be improvement. Medicines Australia looks forward to
ongoing collaboration with the Government to help prepare Australia for unknown future health
challenges.
