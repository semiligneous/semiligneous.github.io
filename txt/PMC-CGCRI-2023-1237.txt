Submission to the Covid-19 Response Inquiry

My personal circumstances are unimportant, except in this regard: my desire to see
politicians, along with their flunkies in the bureaucracy and media, brought to account
for the upheaval, pain and misery they inflicted upon Australians during the years of
covid madness.


The federal government is clearly not sincere in any stated intention toward this end.
This is evidenced by what is NOT to be examined by this inquiry:


Actions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments have been placed
outside the inquiryâ€™s terms of reference.


State Premiers and health officers held centre stage for much of the last four years, using
covid as a spotlight in which they could shine. Daily, from the podium, they used case
statistics obtained with unreliable testing methods to deliver big scary numbers. Actual
deaths from the virus, meanwhile, remained very low.


They enthusiastically promoted vaccine mandates, lockdowns, and masking - all of
which were already known to be ineffective at best in the circumstances which
supposedly prevailed.1


I call upon the federal government to accept its responsibility to Australians - to reframe
the terms of reference for this inquiry and include the actions taken by state and territory
governments.


To ignore their role is akin to investigating the loss of the Titanic and refusing to
acknowledge even the possibility that its sinking may have an involved an iceberg.
Thank you.
