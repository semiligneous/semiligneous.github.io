Personal Story of Discrimination


I was employed for more than                  my employer. I
successfully remotely from my home office while in Covid 19 lockdown. However, I was
fired ifrom my job for not registering as Vaccinated. I lost my income
and as I was living in^HI was not allowed to work in my field until at least^^^^^^|

      Therefore I lost my ability to support my family financially and will not recover from
that financial impact. I also becameThis has also
impacted my family and friends^^^^^

ln^^^^^|my Employer said Vaccine mandates are the responsibility of the
Government not Businesses. The^^| Government did not mandate the Covid 19
Vaccine                               I requested a risk assessment that shows why
vaccination is the best and only control for me against harm from Covid-19, and or the
possible impacts from the vaccination and of which should include a comprehensive
assessment of potential harm from the vaccine. The company never provided this to
me.

Since then evidence from the Western Australian Government (among other states)
(Western Australian Vaccine Safety Surveillance - Annual Report 2021, Produced by
the Immunisation Program, Communicable Disease Control Directorate and the COVID-
19 Vaccination Program, Department of Health, Western Australia) states that there
werel 0,726 individual adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) reports in 2021, up
from 270 in 2020. Of these AEFI, 10,428 (97%) occurred after a COVID-19 vaccine.

I wasso therefore not taking a vaccine meant I had no risk
from any of the adverse reactions identified by the Government. The^^^^^^f

       impact to me from being fired, not being allowed to work is far greater than any
impact the virus has had on me or my family. Taking a vaccination would have only
increased the likelihood of some negative impact.



1.    Key health response measures

      Governance of the Vaccination should include minimising financial, mental and
      physical impacts to all people in Australia including non-vaccinated. This means
      not mandating the Vaccination to maintain employment as there are also injuries
     from vaccination and people need to make there own informed choice. Heard
     immunity did not stop the transmission of Covid 19.

     Isolation of healthy (people not showing symptoms from Covid 19) should not
     occur. Isolation people at risk and managing their immune health is more strategic
     and reduced impact to the larger population mentally, physically and financially.

2.   Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular
     populations

     If the Government wants to mandate vaccination for any type of employment they
     must then hold the job for that person and continue to pay them in full. This will
     reduce the likelihood of negative financial and mental impacts to those people.
     People if they can should be able to work from home rather than be vaccinated.
