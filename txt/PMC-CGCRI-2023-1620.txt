 iput to Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Dear Ms Kruk, Professor Bennett and Dr Jackson,
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this significant inquiry into Australia’s response
to the COVID-19 pandemic, including how we might increase our preparedness to manage
future pandemic events.
Mental Health Australia is the peak, national non-government organisation representing and
promoting the interests of the Australian mental health sector and committed to achieving
better mental health for all Australians. Mental Health Australia represents over 130
members across the full spectrum of mental health stakeholders and issues. Mental Health
Australia also delivers the Embrace Multicultural Mental Health Project, which provides a
national focus on mental health and suicide prevention for people from culturally and
linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds; and auspices the National Mental Health
Consumer and Carer Forum, which is the combined national voice for mental health
consumers and carers.
Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on peoples’ mental health and
wellbeing, as well as access to mental health supports.1 In Australia, the COVID-19
pandemic and lockdowns were associated with an overall increase in psychological
distress amongst people in Australia in 2020 and 2021, and there was a substantial
increase in use of mental health crisis and other support services.2 Initial research
suggests young people, people with pre-existing mental health conditions, and people
experiencing financial disadvantage experienced greater declines in mental health
associated with the pandemic,3 along with there being particular mental health impacts for
health care workers. Research is still exploring the ongoing mental health impacts of the
pandemic, particularly relating to concerning increases in mental health issues amongst
young people.4
Mental Health Australia is pleased to provide the following brief response to the COVID-19
Response Inquiry’s terms of reference, and encourages the inquiry to engage further with
the mental health sector during the targeted stakeholder engagement in early 2024.

National governance mechanisms
The level of collaboration between the Australian, State and Territory Governments in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic was welcome, and provides lessons for ongoing work
across jurisdictions. The joint approach of decision making, which enabled flexibility
and continual adaptation as further information was obtained, should be adopted in
responding to ongoing national mental health challenges, as well as future pandemic events.

Mental health supports for people impacted by COVID-19 or lockdowns
The Australian Government is to be commended for its recognition and action to prevent
mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns, through
targeted investment to bolster the capacity of existing services, as well as establishment of
new supports. This included rapid establishment of online/telephone support through a
Coronavirus Mental Wellbeing Support Service (CMWSS), establishment of 15 HeadtoHelp
hubs in Victoria, access to telehealth for mental health supports, and doubling of the number
of Medicare-subsidised therapy sessions through Better Access.
Overall, experiences with these programs indicates the importance of collaboration
across the sector and integration with existing mental health supports for the
effectiveness of additional mental health supports during a pandemic. Providers have noted
the strength of collaboration in rapidly establishing and delivering the CMWSS and
HeadtoHelp hubs. This level of cooperation relies on an existing foundation of strong
collaboration across the sector. Providers also noted challenges delivering these additional
services in the context of an already over-stretched and fragmented mental health system,
and where additional supports were separate, rather than integrated, with existing services.
It is imperative then that the Australian Government continue to address current gaps
in mental health supports, incentivise collaboration across the mental health sector, and
consider integration with existing services for any additional supports in response to future
pandemics.
Evaluation of the HeadtoHelp initiative in Victoria suggested that overall the hubs were
appropriately designed and implemented, reasonably efficient, and supported a statistically
significant reduction in psychological distress for participants.5 However there were also
challenges in delivering these services, with providers facing extreme difficulties to recruit
and retain staff, with strong workforce competition and short-term contracts with prolonged
uncertainty. Ongoing work is needed to bolster the mental health workforce,6 together
with clear funding arrangements for any ‘pop-up’ or additional services, to ensure that staff
can be retained. The evaluation also highlighted the importance of greater integration
between HeadtoHelp and other services to improve participant outcomes.

The Australian Government is currently working with State and Territory Governments to
establish Adult Mental Health Centres in every jurisdiction (‘Head to Health’ hubs). These
centres have a similar model to HeadtoHelp, and the role of this new network should be
considered as part of a mental health response to future pandemics.
Pandemic-related mental health measures also included a time-limited measure to allow
people an additional 1 Medicare-subsidised therapy sessions through the Better Access
initiative (beyond the standard 10 sessions in a calendar year). While highly valued by
people who were able to access this additional support, the measure did not appear to
address existing inequities in access to mental health support. Evaluation of the Better
Access initiative found that Better Access “serves some groups better than others, and
these gaps are widening”, with greater uptake overtime amongst people in urban areas
and with higher incomes.7
More broadly, there are positive legacies of response to the COVID-19 pandemic in our
mental health system. The appointment of a Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Mental
Health in May 2020 was a welcome recognition of the importance and interconnectedness of
mental health within the broader health system. The permanent establishment of telehealth
items introduced temporarily in March 2020 - including for psychological support - is
extremely welcome. Telehealth services are now a critical and much more common
component of mental health care delivery. Further, quarterly public data reporting on national
use of mental health services through the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
throughout the pandemic vastly improved transparency and timely access to mental health
related data, to support decision making.8

Financial support
Modelling from the Brain and Mind Centre suggests that income support/employment
maintenance initiatives implemented by the Australian Government
                                                                                                          ■9
This is in keeping with previous research regarding the relationship between welfare
spending and suicide rates in countries during economic downturns such as the GFC.10
These findings point to the importance of government measures to support individual
and family financial security in preventing negative mental health impacts of future
pandemics.

Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular
populations

Prioritisation of people with mental illness in vaccination programs
As part of the Equally Well Australia collective, Mental Health Australia urges the Australian
Government to ensure that future vaccination programmes against infectious diseases
give appropriate priority and attention to people living with mental illness and
substance use disorders.11 During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was found people living with
mental illness and substance use disorders are twice as likely to be hospitalised, experience
long-term effects, or die from COVID-19. Despite the overwhelming evidence of these
increased risks, vaccination rates among people with mental illness and substance use
disorders have lagged behind those of the general population.12

Supports for people from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse backgrounds
Through Mental Health Australia’s work in delivering the Embrace Project, we identified
several adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses for CALD
community members, including:
    •    poor communication and translation of public health messages to CALD
         communities,
    •    already underserved CALD communities experiencing further mental health
         pressures and unable to navigate support services
    •    mental health impacts of sudden lockdowns and policing of communities affected by
         trauma - especially refugee communities, and feeling that marginalised
         communities were being unfairly targeted (experiences of racism)
    •    concern for family overseas experiencing high COVID-19 infection rates, and not
         being able to travel to see family.
The Australian Government is to be commended for establishing a CALD Communities
COVID-19 Health Advisory Group, in recognition of the unique challenges faced by culturally
and linguistically diverse communities, and to enable coordinated communication messages
to CALD communities.
There are examples of best practice models throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to
support CALD communities, such as CALD community leaders channelling information
and support directly to communities through cultural and language specific mechanisms,
utilisation of bicultural community workers, and mobilisation of CALD community
organisations.
In 2021, Mental Health Australia commissioned research funded by the National Mental
Health Commission on the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Vietnamese, Turkish
and Italian communities.13 This research is enclosed as evidence in support of
mechanisms to better target future response to the needs of CALD populations.

O        Australia



The research found mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were magnified across
these communities, due to increased levels of social and self-stigma and cultural norms that
place a higher value on community support. Key barriers to effective support included a lack
of understanding regarding how to reach people from CALD backgrounds.
The research recommended governments:
        •    work with communities to co-design response strategies
        •    develop stigma reduction activities to address specific cultural considerations
        •    strengthen, support and enhance the development of a trauma-informed multi­
              lingual workforce
        •    utilise culturally-specific communication channels (e.g., community radio)
        •    identify and promote a referral pathway for CALD people in Australia facing
              relationship tensions.

Mental Health Family Carer experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic
The National Mental Health Consumer and Carer Forum has produced co-designed
research, funded by the National Mental Health Commission, looking at the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the experiences and wellbeing of caregivers supporting people with
mental health challenges.14 This research is enclosed for the inquiry’s consideration.
The research found mental health service closures, changes and restrictions resulted in
feelings of abandonment, increased psychological distress, and growing need for support for
mental health consumers. Family carers provided more hours and more complex
support during the pandemic, many without the assistance of financial, practical or social
resources. The additional stresses resulting from inadequate support during the pandemic
resulted in family carers feeling isolated, overwhelmed, distressed, financially vulnerable,
fearful - and in some cases, experiencing thoughts of suicide.
The research provides short and long-term recommendations for Australian Government
action, including:
        •    creation of carer on-call roles to respond to crises experienced by families
        •    creation of local and regional mobile centres to help families during disasters
        •    establishment of domestic violence services to support carers and consumers
        •    establishment of suicide prevention services aimed at caregivers experiencing
              stress and distress.
Mental Health Australia would be pleased to provide further feedback to the inquiry,
including through facilitating further consultation with our member organisations.
Yours sincerely,



Carolyn Nikoloski
