The government response to COVID-19 failed to consider the cost of social restrictions on
mental health. It also tarnished the reputation of Australia as a country that places a high
value on personal freedoms and freedom of conscience including ensuring informed consent
without coercion when it comes to health measures. There will be long-term negative
ramifications on mental health as well as Australiaâ€™s influence in the global community.

The government did well to inform people of the dangers of COVID-19 but it should have
allowed people to self-regulate. The vulnerable could still have been protected through the
wearing of protective gear around them without locking down the general population.

What was lacking in the government response was a focus on early intervention strategies.
Instead of exploring them, the government chose to shut down this discussion in the severest
way by threatening highly esteemed doctors with the loss of medical registration. There were
highly qualified doctors and scientist who were presenting early intervention and treatment
strategies which have been proven to be effective. The government should have listened to
them.

The cost of building more hospitals would have been less than the costs on the economy from
the lockdowns and the cost of the job-keeper initiative. This would also have eased the
current pressure on the hospital system.
