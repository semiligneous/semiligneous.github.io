COVID-19 Response Inquiry




This submission seeks a full Royal Commission for a proper investigation into:

    •       Vaccine procurement
    •       Secret vaccine contracts
    •       Vaccine mandates
    •       Vaccine injuries
    •       Mask mandates and lockdowns
    •   Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block infection
        and transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gas lighting of the injured.
    •   The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on the harm of the vaccine and their
        action along with ATAGI to silence to silence the Medical Profession.




During the frequent and lengthy lockdowns in Victoria, I was unable to access the regular medical
care that I needed , and my health suffered. I was admitted to hospital and my husband, despite
testing negative to Covid was not allowed to visit me. Being denied the support and advocacy of a
loved one while in hospital is a significant risk to health and well being of the patient, and an abuse
of human rights. Many people died alone in hospital without the support of their family and friends.




A Royal Commission is the most appropriate option to examine Australia's pandemic to Covid-19
response properly.




Yours sincerely
