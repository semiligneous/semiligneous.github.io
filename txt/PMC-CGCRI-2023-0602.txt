Subject: Submission to the Australian COVID Inquiry - Concerns
Regarding Mandatory COVID Vaccination and its Impact on Human
Rights

Dear to whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my deep concern and reservations regarding the
mandatory COVID vaccination measures implemented in response to the
pandemic. As a healthcare worker, I have witnessed firsthand the
complexities and nuances surrounding the vaccination rollout, and I
believe it is crucial to address certain issues that have arisen,
particularly with respect to the Negev active effects of the vaccine and
the potential breaches of human rights.
One of the fundamental principles of a democratic society is the
protection of individual freedoms and human rights. While
acknowledging the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to
ensure that the measures taken in response to it do not inadvertently
infringe upon these rights. The mandatory COVID vaccination policy has
raised significant ethical and legal concerns, particularly when
considering its potential impact on individual autonomy and bodily
integrity.
Furthermore, I would like to share my personal experience as a
healthcare worker who has encountered numerous cases of vaccine
injuries. I have witnessed patients facing adverse effects that extend
beyond the anticipated mild side effects. These occurrences not only
jeopardize the physical well-being of individuals but also have profound
consequences on their mental and emotional health. In particular, my
own family has been affected, as my ^^^^^jendured a vaccine injury
that required^^^^^^^|for recovery, with lingering health issues
persisting to this day.
This raises questions about the thoroughness of the vaccine approval
process and the necessity of a nuanced and individualized approach to
vaccination, considering the potential risks and benefits for each person.
The trust in the medical system has been eroded as a result of these
experiences, contributing to a growing skepticism among the general
public.
Moreover, the overarching response to the pandemic has, in my view,
demonstrated an overreach of government power. While urgent and
unprecedented circumstances warranted swift action, it is essential to
conduct a comprehensive review of the decisions made and the
consequences thereof. The erosion of trust in medicine, coupled with
concerns about the long-term effects of the COVID response, has created
a challenging environment that needs to be addressed to restore public
confidence.
In conclusion, I urge the inquiry to thoroughly investigate the mandatory
COVID vaccination policies and their impact on human rights. It is
imperative to strike a balance between public health imperatives and the
preservation of individual freedoms. Additionally, I recommend a
reevaluation of the overall approach to the pandemic response to rebuild
trust in the medical system and ensure a more measured and
transparent path forward.
Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that the inquiry
will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand.
Sincerely,
Luke Pocock
