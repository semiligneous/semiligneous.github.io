COVID -19 ENQUIRY SUBMISSION



My name is                   I was working as an Education Assistant for a public school^^^^^H
                've been doing this job I loved                                I had to hand in my
keys as I was not willing to have the covid vaccine, number 1) I chose not to have anymore
vaccinations at a younger age because I got sick after vaccination.

I did some research and it wasn't proven to be safe or effective. ) I watched an Oracle film titled 'Safe
and Effective: A second opinion' that describes the harm people had suffered because they believed
the governments narrative that this experimental injection was a 'vaccine' instead of an untested
genetically modified mRNA drug.

I went to my family Dr in ^^^^^^^^^asking for informed consent, the dr could not give me
informed consent.                                                  did not choose this. As December
was coming up, I knew what was coming with the no jab, no job policy playing out, I then went to
another Dr as he was giving out exemptions. He took my blood tests for                       a nd I was
to be given an exemption on my next visit which gave me peace of mind that I would still have my job
that I love. When I called for my blood results and next appt the surgery told me that this particular
Dr had been suspended hence I could not get an exemption, I later learnt that he was suspended for
supporting people with their own health decisions.

                  I was not allowed on the school premises and was left without a job, no discussion,
nothing even though I sent numerous letters, had no reply from anyone in the education
department. Then out of the blue^^^^^^^^^H I had a phone call I can go back to work, phone
call was a Friday I went back to work on the Monday into a position I was not qualified for. Had no
handover just a quick meeting.

I was out of my depth being put in a position with a different pay grade and job title^^^^^H
I ended up feeling quite ill with not knowing what I was doing, had no support etc dealing with
                                 I was not equipped for. I ended up going to people sense for
counselling through all the stress I was put through that year.

This year 2023 I had a traumatic experience at work again as I was in fight/flight mode. Ive had to go
on sick leave. All because I chose not to have a vaccine, my world was turned upside down.
