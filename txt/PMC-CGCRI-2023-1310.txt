   Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

   In relation to "Key health response measures", the resistance of the government to
       allow open debate in order to enforce the vaccination mandate was dangerous.

   From evidence now emerging, these debates should have been allowed. So-called
      'misinformation' should be countered with debate, not shutdown of all alternatives.
      For example, the view that the vaccinations would prevent spread of Covid - now
      proved to be untrue. Such fear driven policy is not appropriate to a democracy and
      an educated population.

   Statistics show that over 90% of the population will likely choose a vaccination in these
       circumstances anyway, so the mandates were not needed. A voluntary population is
       always going to be a happier population than a forced population.

   Public messaging was not well done. A case in point was the ongoing push for children
      to be vaccinated long after it was shown from evidence overseas that this was not
      necessary, and indeed harmful given the number of adverse events [see WA
      publication of adverse events after vaccine role out].

   In relation to “Broader health supports... and/or lockdowns” the evidence suggests that
       the lockdowns themselves were more detrimental to society than Covid itself. While
       short term lockdowns or isolated lockdowns may have helped, the longer term
       lockdowns had a much worse impact on society.

   Preventing loved ones from being with people dying, children growing up with masks,
      students not having proper interaction, cancer patients not receiving prompt
      treatments... all of these accumulate to be worse than Covid itself.

   The government needs to be dynamic and respond to the live information and evidence
      as it emerges. Instead, they seemed to play politics and were afraid of ‘losing face’ if
      they changed their minds.

Best regards,
