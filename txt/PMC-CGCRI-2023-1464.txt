                    | states that a reanalysis of      and ^original clinical trial
data shows that their COVID mRNA vaccines *INCREASE* your risks of serious adverse
events, hospitalization, and death. He further states:




This is the highest quality of scientific evidence.                 is an ER doctor and clinical
data scientist from Louisiana. Associate editor of the BMJ,
                         Some real eminence of integrity published this reanalysis, and what
they found was this. In the trials that led to the approval of regulators worldwide, you were
more likely to suffer a severe adverse event from taking the vaccine, hospitalization, disability,
or life-changing event than you were to be hospitalized with COVID.

This mRNA vaccine should likely have never been approved for a single human in the first
place, and that rate of serious adverse events is at least 1 in 800... 1 in 800 is a very, very high
figure. We've pulled other vaccines for much less. The 1976 Swine Flu vaccine was pulled
because it was found to cause a debilitating neurological condition called Guillan-Barre
syndrome in about 1 in 100,000 people. The Rotavirus vaccine was suspended in 1999 because
it was found to cause a form of bowel obstruction in kids in 1 of 10,000. This is at least 1 in
800. It's a no-brainer. So the question is, why have we not paused it? "
