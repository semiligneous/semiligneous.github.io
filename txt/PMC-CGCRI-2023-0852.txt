                                                                   with Disability Australia
Executive Summary

Children and Young People with Disability Australia (CYDA) is the national representative
organisation for children and young people with disability aged 0 to 25 years. Our vision is that
children and young people with disability are valued and living empowered lives with equality of
opportunity; and our purpose is to ensure governments, communities, and families, are empowering
children and young people with disability to fully exercise their rights and aspirations.
CYDA welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Commonwealth Government’s Covid 19 Inquiry.

Key issues: Children and young people with disability have encountered an elevated degree of risk
throughout the global pandemic, not due to their impairments, but as a result of discriminatory,
limited, or inappropriate policies implemented to manage infections in the community. The absence
of a coherent national strategy in Australia has exacerbated the exclusion, uncertainty, and distress
experienced by these individuals. Our extensive Covid-related policy work outlined in Table 1 below,
sheds light on the inadequacy of targeted responses spanning vaccinations, education, community
support services, and other health impacts.

Terms of Reference (ToR) addressed: In this submission, CYDA seeks to specifically address the
Terms of Reference outlined below.

   •   Key health response measures (for example across COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments,
       and public health messaging).
   •      Community supports (across early childhood education and care, higher education).

Key recommendations: Our overarching recommendation to the Inquiry is to protect children and
young people from the developmental, social, and economic scarring effects of the COVID-19 and
any future pandemics. To achieve this imperative goal, CYDA strongly urges the government to
prioritise the development of a National Children and Young People Recovery Plan. Such a plan
should be comprehensive and designed to mitigate the long-term consequences of COVID-19 and
any future pandemic crisises on the life trajectory of this demographic that experiences increased
vulnerabilities.

CYDA also wholeheartedly endorses the policy recommendations articulated in the collaborative
report by Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY) and UNICEF titled "Kids at
the Crossroads: Evidence and Policy 1 Mitigate the Effects : COVID-19." We encourage the
government to adopt the key recommendations from this report on 1) supporting economic recovery
and strengthen systems, 2) protection against deepening and widening inequalities, 3) promoting
resilience and mental wellbeing and 4) fostering citizenship and fighting disempowerment, as the
foundation to a robust National Recovery Plan. Furthermore, we recommend the inclusion of a
targeted focus in the recovery plan on groups of children and young people, including those with
disability, who have been routinely excluded from government policy both before and during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The following response (Table 1) is informed by CYDA’s consultations with children, young people
with disability and their families conducted during the pandemic and also our previous policy work
on this topic. Direct quotes from these consultations are italicised and have been amended for
clarity and brevity.
