Dear Prime Minister of Australia

Thank you for the opportunity to request a Royal Commission into the handling of Covid-19 across
the whole of Australia.

    •   The Royal Commission in Australia needs to be independently run allowing for TRUTH to be
        told by people giving evidence.
    •   The Royal Commission into Covid-19 needs to aired on television or YouTube (for example) to
        allow people to witness the proceedings.
    •       Evidence can't not be surprised as it has during this whole charade.
    •   Guilty persons need to have the full force of the law thrown at them and they need to be
        charged with War Crimes and Treason.
    •   Compensation for families who lost love ones. Compensation for everyone who's body has
        been altered due to the test injection. Compensation for people who left work due to
        mandates. Compensation for people forced out of their jobs. Compensation for stress caused
        by the uncertainty of the period due to the false narrative told by the governments.
        Compensation for children who missed a year of schooling.
    •   The Royal Commission needs to set up a frame work so this does NOT happen again! The
        people need their power back and the government needs to know the people hold the
        power, not the other way around.



I look forward to the Australian Royal Commission to be undertaken immediately and in the public
arena for everyone to see how it is run. No more lies! No more behind closed doors decisions.
Australia deserves to see and hear what's really going on.

Kind regards
