               Covid response enquiry.

1. The anger that was generated by the media was turned onto individuals who had managed their
health issues without resorting to pharmaceuticals. Health decision making is a basic right for every
one in a democracy without even relying on the lessons of the Nuremberg Trials.
2. There has been no information whereby it is expected that flue viruses can be stopped. When
there is herd immunity the virus disappears and a new variant will appear. From my lifetime
experience (78 years)the thought of a virus does not cause stress. The anger towards me and the
isolation caused by lock downs was stressful. The lack of social engagement caused loneliness and
stress. The exclusion from activities mandated by the government was stressful.
3. The information that the vaccine would stop the spread of Covid was not accurate. This indicates
that in the future it is essential that we have the right to make our own medical decisions. Otherwise
we are living in a communist country instead of a democracy.
4.1 could not continue with my hobby nor earn a living. I saw businesses fold up. Society is coping
as normal now despite lots of variants and Covid as well. But the damage has been done. We hope
that the future government will not allow this to happen again. We want to be able to decide for
ourselves whether we choose to isolate and to take particular medication or to continue living
normally in the short time that I have available left to live.
