C19 Inquiry

A real attempt at lessons learned would only be possible by way of a Royal Commission, which was
promised during the last election by Anthony Albanese, and since his government was elected this
represents the popular will of the majority of Australian people.
Basic question, why no Royal Commission then?
Let's start there, and make it transparent why the government will not keep their promise.
Why indeed...

Unlike a Royal Commission, the terms and scope of this inquiry are too generic and will not establish the
root causes, and therefore no true lessons will be learnt. It is therefore a failure before it even starts,
and a waste of time, morale, and tax payers money, at a time when government spending, and
therefore debt, continues to grow affecting each and every member of this society for generations to
come, especially the young.

How can any lessons be learnt without addressing and getting to the bottom of why Australia's existing
pre-Covid-19 Pandemic Preparedness plan was sidelined...after establishing the Royal Commission as a
first step, this question would be the next step.
Answering that question with a full root-cause analysis would identify clearly the terms of reference and
framework on where to dig next, and so forth and so forth.

Stop throwing sand in our eyes, and start doing your duty. You have a mandate from the population to
fulfil.
