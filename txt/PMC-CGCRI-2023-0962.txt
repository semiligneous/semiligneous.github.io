Submission to the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Firstly, a COVID-19 Response Inquiry is inadequate and there needs to be a Royal Commission for a
full investigation of the following:

    -          Mask mandates
    -          Lockdowns
    -          Vaccine mandates
    -          Border closures
    -          Official misinformation and media lies
    -          Vaccine injuries
    -          Media censorship
    -          Silencing of medical professionals and the role AHPRA and ATAGI played
    -          Authorities acting on misinformation disseminated by the World Health Organisation (WHO)

I am a ■year old, ^^^|of| children, from^^^^^^^^^^^^|and have worked for the
                          my entire career                        and more
recently for

The following events that happened to me as a result of the COVID-19 response will help identify the
areas that need to be investigated:

In October 2021, the NSW Government introduced vaccine mandates for some sectors and
encouraged other employers to mandate vaccinations for their employees.worked for
NSW Health and despite the fact that she worked from home 100% of the time, she was forced to
get vaccinated for COVID-19 to keep her job. As a result of her first (reluctant) Pfizer vaccination, she
was hospitalised within 24 hours and placed on workers compensation, unable to work for many
months as a result of an adverse reaction. Unbelievably NSW Health still expected her to go back for
a second dose so she resigned from her job rather than suffer further damage to her health.

In November 2021, the NSW government and health authorities continued to spread misinformation
to the public (aided by the media) about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine which was
clearly false. It was clear very early on from various studies around the world, available for anyone to
read, that the vaccines did not stop the transmission of COVID-19 and were causing myocarditis and
other serious adverse health effects.

In December 2021, my own employer^^^^^^^^^^^^^Bintroduced a mandatory vaccination
policy for its staff. This was despite no vaccine mandates being in place
staff and other^^^^J contractors who worked in the same buildings.                             brought in
Professorfrom                                        to                all       employees that
only unvaccinated people can spread COVID-19 in the workplace and that there is a suitable COVID-
19 vaccination that is safe for everyone. Dr^^^H directed employees not to question him on the
safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines because he's a 'Doctor' and to 'trust' him.

I did not comply with^^^^'s questionable COVID-19 vaccination policy and raised genuine vaccine
safety concerns on multiple occasions, providing management with evidence, studies and statistics
showing COVID vaccines did not stop transmission and were in fact causing many adverse reactions,
including myocarditis. My safety concerns fell on deaf ears at^^^Banc< । was stood down from my
job, placed on leave without pay, removed from my position, ignored, replaced by a new employee,
and eventually terminated from my employment under the pretence of a 'redundancy'.^^^B
management continued to spread COVID misinformation well into 2022, including that COVID-19
vaccines stopped transmission and vaccines were safe, before eventually going quiet on the topic
and deleting copies of all videos and other incorrect COVID-19 information. To this day they have not
acknowledged they were wrong or apologised for the misinformation they provided to their staff,
many who were coerced into taking two doses of the COVID vaccination to keep their jobs.

As a result of how the government and big corporations over-reacted and mishandled the COVID-19
response I am currently unemployed^^^^|years in ^^^^B(having left a long career that included
                                        Instead, I am now tied up in a ^^^^^^^|case over the
adverse action I received by my former employer for questioning their COVID-19 response.

Through 2021 and 2022 I spoke to numerous doctors who told me "off the record" they would not
recommend me taking any of the COVID-19 vaccines, due to the high number of adverse reactions
they were seeing at their practices, but they were not allowed to give me their true advice due to the
threat of being investigated by AHPRA and losing their medical licence.

What needs to happen:

    -       A Royal Commission into the official COVID-19 response.
    -   Investigate the decisions made by the Federal Government, State Governments and State
        premiers and the advice/science used to justify their disproportionate actions.
    -       Reject the World Health Organisation's pandemic treaty and WHA amendments.
    -       Investigate the actions of AHPRA and ATAGI.
    -   Reject the proposed Misinformation Bill and acknowledge that the main source of COVID-19
        misinformation over the last 4 years was from the Australian Government, health authorities
        and media.


    The attached report dated 9 August 2022 was written by                      and endorsed by Dr
                  Professor of Medicine, Director Centre of Chronic Disease at the^^^^^^^J
                     copy of which I provided to^^^^management as part of an EHS Hazard
    notification I submitted that went unactioned (closed without a safety investigation).
