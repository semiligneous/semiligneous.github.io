Please be advised that I request the Government conduct a fully independent Royal Commission into
every aspect of the Covid Pandemic. The terms of reference must be very wide rangeing and include the
ability to call and and require all evidence and actions of any person the commission considers relevant.
That may include any and all federal and state heads of departments and/or current or former members
of both state and federal parliaments
