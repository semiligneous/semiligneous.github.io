                   Future respiratory viral pandemics are a certainty.^




Investing in ventilation, indoor air quality and appropriate personal protective equipment
now will save lives and prevent economic hardship in the future. The public health "sanitary
reformers" of the late 1800s led the way in overcoming water-borne diseases like cholera
and typhoid fever through investments in sewer systems and water treatment
plants      We are certain that there were those who thought the task at hand was
insurmountable.
