Dear Panel,

This submission details my personal encounters with governmental decisions regarding the
Covid-19 "pandemic" and offers insights derived from my examination of medical literature
and reports from diverse perspectives available to me at the time. I believe that a
comprehensive inquiry falls within the purview of a Royal Commission.

Opening Note:
Jane Halton, a public servant and ANZ Bank member, oversaw Australia's pandemic
response despite lacking medical qualifications in epidemiology, virology, or immunology.
Her involvement in




Personal Experience:
Upon the World Health Organization's announcement of a global pandemic in March 2020, I
was initially alarmed. The call for universal Covid-19 vaccination, despite limited knowledge
of the disease and the rapid vaccine development, seemed disproportionate, especially
considering the virus's statistics. The subsequent global lockdown, economic fallout, and
mass testing and vaccination efforts, including young children, appeared unwarranted.
In early 2021, global excess deaths were absent, contrasting with post-vaccine spikes. The
government and media perpetuated an alarmist climate, pressuring citizens to take the
injections. Witnessing police brutality against peaceful protesters and the coercion of
friends into vaccination, despite adverse reactions, was distressing.
My interest in medical research revealed that proven drugs like Ivermectin and
Hydroxychloroquine were banned, favouring experimental and untested injections. The
government's disregard for citizens' intelligence and common sense bred contempt.
Lessons Learned:
I concluded that trust in the government, agencies, and media was misplaced. False
assurances of vaccine non-mandatoriness, coupled with societal divisions and labels, left
many feeling betrayed. The Covid hysteria exposed courageous experts and critical thinkers
countering misinformation.

Institutional Disqualification:
Powerful figures blindly followed WHO directives, showcasing ignorance or fear of losing
positions. Media played a shameful role, contributing to misinformation. Censorship
signalled Australia's fall to an authoritarian system, violating democratic principles.

Recommendations:
   •   Urgent publication of investigation conclusions before the WHO's May 2024 Treaty
       signing.
   •          Exit the WHO and avoid future collaboration.
   •          Establish a new advisory body of trusted experts.
   •          Collaborate with the World Council for Health and Children's Health Defence.
   •          Publicize TGA-recorded deaths and adverse effects.
       Reform the ABC board and end censorship.
   •         Pursue legal action against Covid-19 injection manufacturers.
   •         Reinstate informed medical consent.
   •         Uphold constitutional rights, avoiding mandates.
   •         Promote natural immunity through healthy living.
   •         Reject fear-mongering and misinformation.
   •         Safeguard free speech and encourage democratic debate.
   •         Acknowledge dissenting scientific papers.
   •         Introduce public duty clauses for balanced parliamentary debates.

Call for a Royal Commission based on panel findings to scrutinize the Covid-19 response in
detail.

Sincerely,
