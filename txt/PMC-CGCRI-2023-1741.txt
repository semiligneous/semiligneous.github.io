Dear People who form the Government of Australia,



      As a citizen of Australia who believes there is more to life than just the
physical things, I am writing to say I am not happy with how the Covid-19
pandemic was handled in Australia.



      The knowledge of pandemic management of previous generations was
ignored. Laws which were destructive to the well-being of the majority were
made. The people's spiritual and social needs were insufficiently met.



      It is good that an independent inquiry is being made concerning the
handling of the pandemic but there needs to be a royal commission inquiry.



      May God bless you,



      Veronica McGuiness
