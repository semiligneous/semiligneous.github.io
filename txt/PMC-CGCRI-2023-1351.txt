Good Afternoon



I would like to submit that the inquiry be changed to a Royal Commission with full powers to
interrogate the range of powers that were enforced by all the State Premiers and Federal Parliament.
No frank discussion with dissenting views were ever attended to and with the current disinformation
bill before Parliament this will only make this situation worse.

Companies were mandated to enforce vaccination before workers could work in the construction
industry, however on questioning our provider of Workers Compensation - no blanket liability would
be covered by them should one of the workers be injured due to the taking of the vaccine - this puts
the companies at risk with no government back up.

Masks were of no use and in actual fact have been shown to cause further problems due to the
possibility of bacterial growth inside the mask - thus encouraging a pneumonia infection - which at
the moment seems to be playing out in China as well as part of Europe (white lung disease).

Fear depletes the natural immune system and the switching of reporting of deaths to infections did
not allay peoples reactions - also the average age of demise of covid patients corresponded to the
normal age of demise in Australia.

Virtually no larger business was closed down (essential business) however all small and medium
family businesses were affected with virtually no compensation for the business owners.

A full disclosure of everything needs to be on the table thus my view that a Royal Commission with
unfettered powers needs to be convened - not just for what has been, but if we do not learn
lessons in what actually worked and what did not - we will never be in a position to face any further
pandemics with actual learnt strategies. Please do not just have an inquiry this will be a waste of our
money and just a whitewash.

Thank you
