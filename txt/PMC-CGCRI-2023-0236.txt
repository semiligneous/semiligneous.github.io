RENAE SUTTIE - "COVID 19 Response Inquiry" Submission.

I am a self-employed professional musician of over 32 years. I have never been out of work
nor applied for government financial assistance during this time, except for during the Old
Covid 19 lockdowns in 2020 which resulted in my being out of work for 6 months. The
impact of this also resulted in us having to shift house.

As someone who chose not to take part in the experimental Covid 19 vaccination, the
divisive Qld government vaccination mandates of 2022 resulted in my losing 6 months'
worth of work; being replaced on all my contracts and productions; being ostracised from
society; losing friends; being excluded from family and social events; the inability to travel
freely or attend public places; tarnished professional and personal identity; having my
personal medical details and values made public; and ongoing trauma and mental health
issues.

This has also resulted in my no longer trusting the government or the media and ceasing to
listen to or read the news as of 21st May 2022. (The day of the latest federal election).

While society tries to quickly move on and rebuild their lives from the havoc and
devastation caused by the government's response to the Covid 19 pandemic, I will never
forget the trauma my family and I and other Covid 19 unvaccinated people experienced and
continue to deal with on a daily basis.
