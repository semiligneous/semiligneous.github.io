In December 2020 the following facts were known about Covid-19 without a
reasonable doubt:
     •    The infection fatality rate (IFR) for the entire population was less than
1%.
     •             The IFR for anyone under 55 was 0.01% or lower.
     •             The IFR for children was near zero
With this information available how on earth could the government's response be
justified- medically,economically and socially there was no need for emergency
lockdowns which prevented families being with loved ones. Closures of schools
and mask wearing had no scientific benefit and the issue of no informed consent
in relation to vaccine mandates needs to be investigated
People died due to the false advertising of safe and effective and those who
suffered injuries need to be supported. The government and its advisers got it
wrong!
