Regardless of the constitution of the day, all regulatory bodies must place equally and without
preference the sovereign individualâ€™s right to body autonomy, full and transparent informed
consent, right to hear transparent scientific discussion, transparent policy making, public
discussion, transparent budgets, all contractual agreements involving taxpayer funded purchases,
the right to open debate, public protest, and personal safety above all other governance policies.
The role of governance will be to support community needs without any physical, mental or
emotional violence toward the individual.
