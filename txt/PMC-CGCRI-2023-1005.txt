COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT COVID-19 RESPONSE ENQUIRY




Australia's response to COVID, I believe, was so incompetent and deceptive that nothing short of a
Senate Enquiry will call to account the people [and State and Federal Governments] who made bad
decisions, and hopefully make a template for any future pandemics to be handled competently.




Here are only some of the matters that should be investigated:

    1.       The lies told by medical "experts" - eg vaccines are Safe & Effective!!!
    2.       How many people did the lockdowns kill?
    3.      How many people did the vaccines kill?
    4.   How many families were broken by the financial pressures created by those who chose
         personal health over Mandatory vaccinations?
    5.      How many businesses went broke?
    6.      Why was natural immunity [as proven by past epidemics] ignored?
    7.   The collusion between Government and Media to spread misinformation, and also prevent
         publication of the truth of such things as the Origin of the Virus.
    8.   Family members prevented from crossing State boundaries when their close relatives were
         dying.
    9.      The list is short, but could be pages long. I think you get the point.



Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely

Ian Moncrieff.
