        Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry

I have one simple question: Why weren't the Flu Pandemic Plans of 2019 followed
(https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/australian-health-management-plan-
for-pandemic-influenza-ahmppi?language=en )? These stressed, for example, the need for a
PROPORTIONATE response, DE-ESCALATION following more information about the virus
coming to light, interventions TARGETED at vulnerable age groups. Why on earth did we
have mass masking requirements, lockdowns, vaccination programs and so on as well as
contact tracing? All of this was disproportionate, prolonged and targeted the ENTIRE
POPULATION. What a joke. If the government is going to spend time and money creating
(good) pandemic plans, FOLLOW THEM.

Kind regards,
Emily
