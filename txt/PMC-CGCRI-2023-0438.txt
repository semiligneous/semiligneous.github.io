I am appalled at the Commonwealth Governments Covid response. We need a thorough
investigation into the following issues.

1. vaccine procurement and secret contracts

2'mask mandates

3-official misinformation

4'lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block transmission

5'media censorship

6'vaccine injuries

7'silencing of doctors

8'the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors

9'the poor treatment of vaccine injured victims, which included denial of vaccine injuries
and gaslighting of Australians injured from the Covid injections.

10. I would also add an investigation needs to be undertaken into the Covid injection
mandates as the Commonwealth mandated aged care workers to get the Covid injection.
Also, with the support and endorsement of the Commonwealth states were able to
implement jab mandates due to the Commonwealth data sharing arrangements and
the sharing of vaccination databases which the Commonwealth allowed the States to
access, and the Commonwealth neglected to protect the human rights of the
Australian people from human rights abuses from the States and from abuse and
coercion from private businesses.
Australians urgently need a proper Royal Commission and a proper investigation into the
Commonwealth Governments Covid response.



Yours sincerely,



Stephen Coughlan
