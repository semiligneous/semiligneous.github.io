Covid Response Inquiry Submission. 13/12/2023




To whom it may concern.




During most of this period I was treated without human rights by many businesses and
governments.

I was prohibited from entering lunch rooms or using toilets almost everywhere I went.

I had to learn to defecate even when I didn’t feel the need to go; and I learned to urinate in bottles
constantly leading to a very intolerant bladder and lost the ability to hold my pee for any sort of
normal time.

Businesses and organisations felt it perfectly acceptable to treat contractors and visitors in
extremely poor ways which the human rights commissioner believes is a violation of human rights.

I believe governments empowered businesses to discriminate in such heinous ways due to their
own politically charged methods of responding to the pandemic.

The Covid response in my opinion gave the necessary conditions for Australia to adopt a
constitutional bill of rights.

The Australian economy and needs of citizens required my services but were thankless in their
ongoing treatment of me.

Conducting my life as a truck driver felt like being a prisoner in a science fiction movie.

Having to spend hours and hours in line for a Covid test after a 16 hour shift every few days are
actions which will never be forgivable.

Living in an LGA with a “regional” hospital despite being so close to the city felt like crossing the
Berlin Wall to access essential services in neighbouring LGA’s.


Australia abandoned its principles during Covid and I will never forget.


Whilst my expectation is for policy to have a fundamental human factor to solve these issues and
be better prepared for a future pandemic; government policy in many areas do not contain a
human factor by any measure so I am confident the Commonwealth Government will continue to
be an untrusted organisation in all future crisis.
