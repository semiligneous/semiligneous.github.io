Submission to the Covid-19 Response Inquiry




I am an Australian citizen and a farmer since    In addition to my employment I have contributed
to my local community for around 40 years in many aspects such as being a member of theH
                       Jthe local dance school.

When I visited my doctor regarding a health matter entirely unrelated to covid in late 2021, she was
strongly insistent that I get vaccinated with an experimental vaccine which only had provisional reg­
istration with the TGA. She was acting under the direction of an APRHA position statement of 9
March 2021 (1) I declined the offer of an injection and she asked why. My response was that I was
not a person in an 'at risk' category and that I when I was growing up I knew a number of children
adversely affected by a previously new medication, thalidomide, administered to their mothers
while pregnant.

I wish to know why the TGA has continued to approve the provisionally approved covid gene­
vaccines when the Australian excess death rate been above the baseline rate since 2021(2) and when
other traditional protein based covid vaccines are being developed and available, one of which is
even Australian?(3,4)
