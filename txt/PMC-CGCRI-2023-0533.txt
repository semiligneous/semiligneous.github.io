         Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

To whom this may concern,

I am writing this submission to contribute to the inquiry regarding the events that took place
not too long ago. After witnessing and experiencing those events as a civilian, I have compiled a
list of issues that the Australian government and all associated parties should investigate and
address.

   1.     The complete violation of human rights in a so called "democratic" country
   2.     Police brutality against civilians on all levels, past and present
   3.     Police corruption on all levels, past and present
   4.     Government corruption on all levels, past and present
   5.     Pharmaceutical company corruption on all levels, past and present
   6.     Justice system corruption on all levels, past and present
   7.     Australian health system corruption on all levels, past and present
   8.     Public and private business corruption on all levels, past and present
   9. Excessive government censorship of different opinions and advice on all levels, past and
       present
   10.      Lack of support for quality scientific research in Australia
   11.      Being overly reliant on overseas pharmaceutical companies
   12. The complete unclassified contents of the covid-19 injection contracts signed by the
       Australian government have yet to be made public
   13.      Excessive money printing during the lockdowns
   14.      Coercion and blackmailing of civilians if they don't undertake a medical procedure
