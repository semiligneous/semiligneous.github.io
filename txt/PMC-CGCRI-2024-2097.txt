Ongoing Vaccination Policy

The current situation is that there is often long period of time between vaccines being
approved by the TGA and being made available by ATAGI for general use. There should
be an obligation on ATAGI to justify withholding a vaccine after it has been approved by
the TGA.

The most significant example of a vaccine not being released is the Pfizer Comirnaty
Original vaccine for children under 5. This was approved by the TGA on 13 July 2023 but
still has not been made available for general use by ATAGI. I do not understand the logic
behind this decision. I would have thought that all young children deserve the best
available protection from COVID - we certainly look after them in other health aspects
including multiple other vaccinations from birth to 4 years.
