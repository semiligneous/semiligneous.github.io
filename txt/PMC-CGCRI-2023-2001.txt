Recommendations
Forge a national funding agreement on prevention

    The federal government should boost investment in prevention
    through a new national funding agreement.

    The new Australian Centre for Disease Control (ACDC) should
    have improving equity as a core goal.

Reform primary care funding

    The federal government should ensure the new funding model
    for primary care is adjusted to patient need, taking account of
    demographics and socio-economic factors.

    The federal government - through Primary Health Networks -
    should work with the states to co-commission services in areas
    where there are few primary care services.

Create a new national vaccination agreement

    The federal and state governments should commit to a vaccine
    equity strategy, as part of a new vaccination agreement.

    The federal government should set targets to boost vaccination
    coverage and equity.

    The new national vaccination system should include three tiers
    of measures - universal, targeted, and tailored - to ensure equal
    access to vaccinations across communities.

Build new information systems

    Primary Health Networks should monitor antiviral uptake in their
    catchments and across clinics.

    Primary Health Networks should work with state governments to
    improve supply of antivirals in harder-to-reach communities.

Gaps in health outcomes

The rising rates of health risk factors, increasing prevalence of chronic
disease, and poor access to needed care for some, all compound to
widen gaps in Australians’ health outcomes.

Men and women who live in poorer areas can expect to die six
years and four years earlier than those who live in wealthy areas.17
Indigenous Australians, and Australians with little formal education,
can expect to die about eight years younger than their fellow citizens.
People who live in rural areas will die about two to three years earlier,
on average, than people who live in cities.18

And because chronic diseases contribute a lot to these gaps,
disadvantaged people will spend more years living in ill health than
other Australians, even though they die earlier.19

Despite these clear benefits, disadvantaged Australians - who are                              No bachelor's

Even when COVID vaccination coverage was highest, disadvantaged                                  Low income
Australians were far more likely to miss out. Analysis of first-dose

Low COVID vaccination rates for high-risk adults have big conse­
quences. They make Australia sicker overall, and entrench unfair gaps
in health outcomes between different communities.

COVID antivirals reduce the severity of illness, minimising the risk of              60%

antivirals, such as Paxlovid and Lagevrio, are recommended for people
at higher risk of severe illness from COVID. This includes, for example,
people older than 70, people older than 50 with additional risk factors,
and Indigenous people older than SO.30

Yet Grattan analysis shows that those most at risk of severe illness
from COVID are less likely to get needed COVID antivirals (see
Figure 1.6 on the next page).

For example, high-risk people in the lowest socio-economic decile
are 60 per cent less likely than high-risk people in the highest
socio-economic decile to get antiviral treatment (see Figure 1.6 on the
following page). High-risk people living in remote areas are 80 per cent
less likely to get antiviral treatment than people living in major cities,                                       Number of vaccine access risks

How to prepare for the next pandemic



Getting a new national vaccination system in place now will put             up to get treatments to the people who need them most next time,
Australia in a strong position for the next pandemic.                       avoiding the failures we have seen during the COVID pandemic.

Reaching out and co-designing services in harder-to-reach
communities is hard to do, and much harder in the midst of a crisis
when fear and misinformation are at their peak. But if robust systems
are in place come the next pandemic, it will be much easier to ensure
all Australians get the best chance of receiving available vaccinations.


2.4   Boosting access to COVID antivirals

Reforms to primary care, as proposed in Section 2.2 on page 13, will
help ensure people get COVID treatments more quickly.

A new needs-based primary care funding model, with loadings
for demographic and socio-economic factors, will improve care for
disadvantaged Australians, and better enable them to get COVID
antivirals. But these reforms to primary care will take time, so the
federal government must urgently take other steps to improve
Australians’ access to COVID antivirals.

Primary Health Networks should monitor antiviral uptake in their
catchments and across clinics. The federal Department of Health
should support this by using de-identified individual-data from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the department should commission
specific services in areas where prescription of antivirals are low.

Primary Health Networks should also work with state governments
to improve supply of antivirals in harder-to-reach communities (see
Section 2.3).

Like targets and tailored programs for vaccination, this will help get
the system ready for future pandemics. Primary Health Networks, GP
clinics, and pharmacies will have the data, tools, and skills to better
serve groups that are missing out on antivirals today. That will set them
