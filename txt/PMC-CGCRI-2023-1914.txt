To whom it may concern,

the Federal government and Western Australia’s actions as part of the World Economic Forum’s false
pandemic were unconstitutional, malicious and vindictive.

I would like roual commission to doggedly investigate via the ICAM process in order to determine the
root causes of the following disasyrous actions:

1. Personal and business lock downs

2. School closures

3. Border closures across our federated States

4. Vaccine procurement process

5. Secret contracts for vaccine delivery

6. AHPRA and ATAGI's role in doctor's censorship and oppression

7. Vaccine injury suppression and censorship

8. The WA vaccine commander role; why did we need a mechanism for forced vaccination?

Regards,

Mac Nichols
