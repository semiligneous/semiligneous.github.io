I am a regular Australian seeing the negative impact of Covid treatment and Covid Vaccine mandate
have in my communities.

This includes:

    •        Mental health issues caused by the lock down.
    •        Suicide caused by the lock down.
    •        Elderly and regular Australian being treated badl^^jniustl^^olic^ctin^ik^hug^^^
    •        Dictatorial behaviour by state leaders such

    •    Financial issues caused by people who were not able to work because of the lock down and /
         or vaccine mandate.
    •    Family breakdown, students are not allowed to go to school, workers retrenchment because
         of the vaccine mandate.
         Immediate and long term health issues resulting from the jab
         myocarditis to name a few).
    •         Death caused by the Covid vaccine.

Just a small sampling of studies below are proofs that the mask, the lock down and the vaccine
mandates are unjustified, even resulting in detrimental result to human's well-being.

    •   Mask study shows ‘little to no difference' in preventing COVID, Flu infection. Cochrane

I call on a proper investigation into:

    •        Corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts.
    •        Mask mandates.
    •        Lock downs.
    •        Vaccine mandates.
    •   Official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
        transmission.
    •   Unjust and cruel behaviour by the police towards people who speak up against the lock
        downs and mandates.
    •        Vaccine injuries.
    •        Media censorship, silencing of doctors.
    •        The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors.
    •   The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in suppressing effective medication such as ivermectin and
        hydroxychloroquine so the government can push the vaccine mandate.
    •        The poor treatment of victims.
