To the Covid Enquiry,



As a member of the public during the Covid times I would like to let you know my opinions and ask some questions. I
would also like to request a full and open royal commission as was suggested before the last election.

    •   Were any decisions made by the Prime Minister not lawful, that is, did they not follow the Constitution of the
        Commonwealth of Australia? For example, creating a National Cabinet where minutes of the meetings were
        not made available to the public.
    •   Were decisions made by State Premiers not lawful, for example, stopping Australians crossing State
        boundaries when our passports say we have lawful access to all of Australia.
    •   What was the legal basis for mandates? As you would know, the Nuremburg Code advises that we should not
        be forced or coerced into a medical procedure. We were coerced. If we refused, then we lost freedoms that
        should be ours by rights. It also went against the Australian Vaccination Code. This was a medical trial.
    •   The Australian all-cause mortality numbers have increased since the rollout of the jabs, and the Senate voted
        against investigating that. Please investigate that.
    •   Please listen to the whistleblower data from the New Zealand pay per dose database and examine similar
        data for Australia- or hand that investigation to a royal commission if your powers do not extend that far. Liz
        Gunn's interview with Barry Young.
    •   I lost work and income as a result of the mandates and now the value of a dollar is less than it was before
        Covid, which I would suggest is a result of Government spending during Covid. How much money was
        printed? How much did our national debt increase? How many Australians are now struggling financially as a
        result of decisions made? What has been the financial impact for everyday Australians?
    •   Now that the science is being heard and the 'safe and effective' narrative has crumbled, will you look
        squarely at the data available and report truthfully on the numbers of people who are jabbed who have had
        Covid multiple times (not effective)? Will you allow reporting of data to show how many Austrlaians have
        died and been injured by the jabs (not safe)?
    •       How much money was paid to companies and individuals to promote the Govt narrative?
    •      Why were dissenting opinions silenced? Where was a debate between points of view?
    •   Why was mainstream media not reporting dissenting opinions? Why were the protests not reported
        accurately? Why were the actions of Victoria Police shooting unarmed protesters with rubber bullets not
        made visible to the public? Why are experts being silenced in the media? Who has made the decision to only
        show the narrative on mainstream media?
    •   I absolutely DO NOT WANT THE WHO making decisions for Australians. It was pretty obvious that nations
        around the world followed policies in lock step- issued by who? By the WHO, the UN? We must make our
        own decisions here.
    •   I do not trust the Government, Health officers and most doctors as a result of the last few years. It is time to
        clean up your act folks.
