Covid inquiry submission


   1. Make no medical sense. The vaccinated can still get sick and infect others,
      while the unvaccinated are maligned as ‘unclean’ even if they are healthy.
   2. Are a major threat to liberty. They force Australians to trade freedoms they
      were born with for immense State power over their body.
   3. Replace informed consent with coercion.
   4. Ignore the power of natural immunity from infection.
   5. Assume no reason for abst< ninq. Religious beliefs, youthful health, and
      previous vaccine injury are all fair reasons to abstain from a vaccine.
   6. Create discrimination. Excluding 10-20% of the population from everyday life
      creates medical apartheid and a two-tiered society.
   7. Are politically toxic. They have sparked unprecedented protests globally, for
      all of the above reasons.
