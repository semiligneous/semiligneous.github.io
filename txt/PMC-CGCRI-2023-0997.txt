Submission Requesting a Royal Commission into the Australian Government's COVID-19
Response

To the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet:

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the limitations of the current COVID-19 Response
Inquiry and to request the establishment of a Royal Commission for a comprehensive and
independent investigation into the Australian Government's handling of the pandemic.

The current inquiry, with its short timeframe and narrow scope, fails to address the multitude of
serious concerns surrounding the government's response. This includes:

    •   Procurement of vaccines and potential corruption: The lack of transparency surrounding
        vaccine contracts and the potential for conflicts of interest raise serious questions that
        require thorough investigation.

    •   Mandates and restrictions: The implementation of mask mandates, lockdowns, and vaccine
        mandates significantly impacted the lives of Australians. A Royal Commission is necessary to
        examine the evidence base for these measures, their effectiveness, and their impact on
        individual rights and freedoms.

    •   Misinformation and censorship: The public was subjected to conflicting and confusing
        information throughout the pandemic, both from official sources and the media. A Royal
        Commission must investigate the role of government agencies and media outlets in
        disseminating misinformation and suppressing dissent.

    •   Vaccine safety and injuries: Concerns regarding vaccine safety and the potential for adverse
        effects deserve thorough investigation. The silencing of doctors and researchers who raised
        these concerns is unacceptable and requires independent scrutiny.

    •   The role of AHPRA and ATAGI: The actions of AHPRA and ATAGI in silencing and censuring
        doctors who expressed alternative viewpoints raise serious concerns about medical freedom
        and professional autonomy. A Royal Commission must investigate their role in this process.

    •   Treatment of victims: The Australian Government's response to the pandemic often seemed
        to neglect the needs and suffering of those who experienced adverse effects from
        vaccines, lockdowns, or other measures. A Royal Commission must ensure that their voices
        are heard and their concerns addressed.

The current inquiry, with its limited scope and short timeframe, is inadequate to address these
critical issues. A Royal Commission, with its broader powers and independent oversight, is necessary
to ensure a thorough and impartial investigation that can:

    •       Uncover any potential wrongdoing and hold those responsible accountable.

    •       Restore public trust in government and medical institutions.

    •   Provide closure and support to those who have been adversely affected by the government's
        response.

        Inform future policy decisions to ensure a more effective and ethical response to future
        crises.
Therefore, I urge the Australian Government to establish a Royal Commission without delay to
conduct a comprehensive and independent investigation into its COVID-19 response. This is essential
for ensuring accountability, restoring trust, and learning from the mistakes of the past to better
prepare for future challenges.

Thank you for your time and consideration.



Yours Sincerely

Ratu Mara
