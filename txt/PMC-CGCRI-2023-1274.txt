COVID-19 Response Enquiry

I am making a submission as a private citizen, discriminated against by the educational institution I
served for 3 years, due to my health choices. This has resulted in enormous personal loss and
academic loss to the aforementioned community. This submission will outline some of the arguments I
believe to be paramount in considering a nuanced response to the actions taken by various levels of
government during 2020-2021.

We acknowledge the multifaceted responsibilities shared between the Commonwealth and state and
territory governments, as well as various national governance mechanisms, including the National
Cabinet, but the perspective presented here advocates for a balanced and decentralised approach.
This submission contends that neither the Federal Government nor the states and territories should
exercise centralised control. Instead, the emphasis should be on providing guidance and choices for
individuals who prioritise the principles of freedom and bodily autonomy, in opposition to mandating
health choices which should be highly individually-led and advocated for, in a world where
one-size-fits-all approaches are seen as archaic . This submission will articulate why a more
decentralised and flexible approach is essential to respect the diverse perspectives and values within
the Australian community, especially in matters concerning individual health choices.

A crucial aspect of advocating for a decentralised approach to COVID-19 vaccination mandates for
essential workers involves expressing a broader concern about the erosion of individual freedoms
through measures such as mask mandates, vaccine mandates, lockdowns, and curfews. While
acknowledging the importance of public health measures in controlling the spread of the virus, it is
imperative to scrutinise the necessity and proportionality of these restrictions. The imposition of such
measures raises legitimate concerns about the potential overreach of governmental powers.




A decentralised approach emphasises that neither the Commonwealth Government nor state/territory
authorities should wield absolute control over vaccination mandates. Instead, the focus should shift
towards providing comprehensive guidance and fostering an environment where individuals can make
informed choices aligned with principles of freedom and bodily autonomy, which includes the promotion
of various medications to support a wide range of health needs in our diverse population, instead of
only promoting one solution through various voices, more prominently mainstream media outlets and
public figures or influencers. This approach ended up dividing the population instead of promoting
positive responses and educating them about public health. Decentralisation allows for a more nuanced
understanding of regional dynamics and ensures that policy responses remain flexible and adaptable to
the diverse needs of the Australian population.

Crucial to the argument for decentralisation is the recognition of individual choices. While public health
imperatives necessitate vaccination efforts, it is equally imperative to respect the autonomy of
individuals in making decisions about their health. Mandates, particularly for essential workers such as
teachers, should be reframed as recommendations rather than strict requirements, allowing individuals
to assess the risks and benefits based on their unique circumstances.The emphasis on guidance over
mandates is crucial for striking a balance between public health imperatives and individual freedoms.
Governments, both at the federal and state/territory levels, should focus on providing comprehensive
information about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, addressing concerns, and actively engaging with
communities. This approach allows for a more inclusive dialogue that considers diverse perspectives,
cultural variations, and individual circumstances.

In the case of Secretary, Department of Education v Dawking [2023] NSWPICPD 23 (1 May 2023) (see
reference section for link) , Dr. Paul Wood, the appellant’s Executive Director of Educational Standards,
provided a statement outlining the timeline of events regarding the COVID-19 vaccination mandate for
education workers. According to Dr. Wood, the New South Wales Government mandated COVID-19
vaccinations for education workers on 27 August 2021, with a deadline for full vaccination set for 8
November 2021. The appellant, Department of Education, implemented determinations requiring
employees to be fully vaccinated unless medically contraindicated, with disciplinary actions for
non-compliance. Dr. Wood detailed various communications, guidelines, and directives issued by the
appellant, emphasising the seriousness of non-compliance. Notably, he mentioned a policy introduced
in November 2021 for managing non-compliance, where cases were referred to the Professional Ethical
Standards Directorate for individual assessment. The case also refers to Dr. Wood's oral evidence,
highlighting key points such as the limited basis for vaccination exemptions, the small number of
non-compliant staff, and the requirement for fully vaccinated staff to return to schools from May 2022,
even if not all were fully vaccinated. This legal context provides insights into the enforcement and
implementation of COVID-19 vaccination mandates in the education sector.

The actions outlined in the case of Secretary, Department of Education v Dawking [2023] NSWPICPD
23 (1 May 2023) reveal a concerning level of harshness and overreach in enforcing COVID-19
vaccination mandates for education workers. The mandated vaccination deadline, coupled with the
imposition of disciplinary actions for non-compliance, suggests a rigid approach that may not fully
consider individual circumstances or potential medical contraindications, as Dawking was single-dose
vaccinated but experienced an adverse effect to the vaccine. The detailed communications, guidelines,
and directives, as presented by Dr. Paul Wood, underscore the severity with which non-compliance was
addressed by DET, potentially raising questions about the proportionality of the response. Moreover, the
limited basis for vaccination exemptions, coupled with the notation of disciplinary actions remaining on
a teacher's record, points to a stringent enforcement strategy that might not adequately accommodate
the diverse and complex situations that individuals may face. It is crucial to critically examine the
balance between public health imperatives and the preservation of individual rights, raising concerns
about the potential overreach of governmental powers in navigating the complexities of pandemic
response.
To address these concerns and ensure accountability, there is a compelling need for a comprehensive
COVID inquiry. This inquiry should delve into all aspects of how the pandemic was handled, examining
the effectiveness of various interventions, including state and territories’ measures, assessing the
impact on individual freedoms, and scrutinising the decision-making processes that led to the
implementation of certain measures. A transparent and independent inquiry would not only address
lingering questions but also serve as a crucial mechanism for learning and refining future pandemic
responses. By demanding a thorough investigation, we assert our right to a clear understanding of the
events that shaped our response to the pandemic and advocate for a more transparent and
accountable governance framework moving forward.
