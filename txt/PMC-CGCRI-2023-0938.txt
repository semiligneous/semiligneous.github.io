Subject: Comprehensive Review of Australia's COVID-19 Response: In-Depth Submission to
the Inquiry

To the Esteemed Members of the Independent Panel,

I submit this comprehensive document to articulate profound concerns regarding specific facets
of Australia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While appreciating the Inquiry's intent to
enhance pandemic preparedness, there are critical areas that demand an exhaustive
examination, given the far-reaching impacts on our society.

Concerns Over Specific Pandemic Measures

1. Mask and Vaccine Mandates: The implementation of mask and vaccine mandates, while
intended to safeguard public health, has raised questions about their necessity, effectiveness,
and proportionality. A meticulous review is imperative to ascertain the true impact on individual
freedoms, social dynamics, and overall public health outcomes.

2. Lockdowns and Curfews: The profound economic, social, and psychological consequences
of lockdowns and curfews necessitate a thorough evaluation. Understanding the long-term
effects of these measures on Australian society, including their appropriateness and efficacy, is
paramount to shaping future responses to similar crises.

3. Communication Strategies: The pervasive use of fear in public health messaging demands
scrutiny. Analyzing the effectiveness and ethical implications of communication strategies during
the pandemic is crucial to ensuring that future public health campaigns strike the right balance
between informing the public and avoiding unnecessary panic and distress.

4. Excess Deaths Post-Vaccination: The recent increase in excess deaths following
COVID-19 vaccinations requires urgent investigation. A meticulous examination of these cases
is vital to address concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and public trust. Transparency in this
matter is key to maintaining confidence in vaccination efforts.

5. Contractual Arrangements with Vaccine Providers: A comprehensive review must extend
to the contractual arrangements made between the government and vaccine providers.
Scrutinizing these agreements ensures accountability, transparency, and a thorough
understanding of the motivations and considerations influencing vaccine distribution and
administration.

6. Australia's Independence in Decision-Making: It is imperative for Australia to retain its
autonomy in decision-making and not be unduly influenced by external entities. While
respecting WHO recommendations, Australia should make independent decisions aligned with
its unique circumstances and values, ensuring that global guidelines are adapted judiciously to
the national context.
7. Independent Testing Authority for Vaccine Safety and Efficacy: To foster trust in
vaccination efforts, Australia should establish its own independent testing department dedicated
to assessing the safety and efficacy of vaccines. This initiative would provide an additional layer
of assurance to the public, ensuring that vaccines introduced into the population meet stringent
national standards.

8. Discrimination Based on Vaccination Status: Addressing concerns related to
discrimination based on vaccination status is paramount. The potential exclusion of individuals
from accessing medical, travel, and general business and retail services based on their
vaccination status raises ethical questions that demand careful consideration. An inclusive
review should assess the impact of such policies on social cohesion and individual liberties.

9. AHPRA's Treatment of Medical Practitioners: The distressing manner in which AHPRA
(Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency) has handled medical practitioners who spoke
out against forced vaccination requires thorough scrutiny. Instances of professionals facing
adverse consequences, including difficulties returning to work, must be thoroughly investigated
to ensure the fair treatment of experts contributing to public discourse.

10. Economic Impact on Logistics and Manufacturing: The lasting macro and
microeconomic impacts on logistics and manufacturing are of utmost concern. Supply chain
disruptions, increased production costs, and operational challenges have not only affected
businesses but have broader implications for the national economy. A thorough examination is
necessary to understand the depth and duration of these impacts.

11. Inflation and Economic Stability: The pandemic's economic fallout has contributed to
inflationary pressures, affecting the cost of living for Australians. An in-depth analysis is crucial
to understand the contributing factors, assess the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures,
and formulate strategies to maintain economic stability in the post-pandemic era.

12. Government Accountability and Responsibility: The reluctance of both federal and state
governments to take responsibility for the outcomes of their respective responses is a matter of
great concern. A comprehensive review should investigate the decision-making processes,
accountability structures, and the extent to which governments acknowledge and learn from the
consequences of their actions.

13. Lack of Cost/Benefit Consideration: A critical examination is needed regarding the lack of
apparent cost/benefit consideration in the implementation of various measures. Evaluating the
economic, social, and health costs against the benefits of each measure is crucial for future
decision-making and policy development.

14. Unwillingness to Listen to Diverse Expert Viewpoints: The government's apparent
unwillingness to consider diverse expert viewpoints in formulating pandemic response strategies
is a troubling trend. A comprehensive review should assess the degree to which the government
incorporated varied perspectives, fostering an environment where dissenting opinions are
valued for a more robust decision-making process.

15. TGA's Adverse Effects and Deaths Reporting Methodology: An investigation into TGA
(Therapeutic Goods Administration) is imperative, particularly in assessing the reporting
methodology for adverse effects and deaths related to vaccination. The fitness for purpose of
the current reporting system should be thoroughly examined to ensure accurate and
comprehensive data collection, contributing to informed decision-making.

Concerns Over the Composition and Scope of the Inquiry

1. Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have expressed
support for certain pandemic measures introduces a potential bias. To ensure objectivity and
impartiality, members with preconceived opinions should consider recusal. An unbiased
assessment of the government's response requires an impartial panel.

2. Exclusion of Unilateral State and Territory Government Decisions: The omission of
actions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments, such as lockdowns and border
controls, is a glaring oversight. These decisions significantly shaped the nation's pandemic
response and must be thoroughly examined to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
overall effectiveness of measures implemented.

3. Police Brutality and Enforcement Measures: Instances of police brutality in enforcing
pandemic-related restrictions have emerged, raising concerns about the proportionality of
enforcement measures. A comprehensive review should evaluate the impact of heavy-handed
enforcement on public trust and mental health, ensuring that emergency measures respect
individual rights and maintain public confidence.

The Need for a Comprehensive Review

While the Inquiry's Terms of Reference are extensive, the inclusion of the aforementioned areas
is essential for a truly comprehensive review. Examining all aspects of the government's
response, even those currently outside the Inquiry's scope, is vital to providing a nuanced
understanding of the challenges faced and the appropriateness of the measures taken.

Conclusion

This submission represents a collective call for a meticulous, unbiased investigation into
Australia's COVID-19 response. It emphasizes the need for freedom and liberty to be upheld
even in times of crisis, urging the Inquiry to consider these points to ensure transparency,
accountability, and the safeguarding of Australian values and liberties.
