I hereby submit my interest in making my submission to your inquiry as follows:

The public have been very misled by the handling of the covid 19 response. It is now being shown that all the
responses that were put in place, have had detrimental effects on all of us that will be in play for many years to
come. Our health system is a shambles, our education system is the same and the flow on to our housing and
economic situations is very dire indeed. Locking away healthy human beings and stripping away our human
rights was definitely not conducive to a well handled covid response. The fear tactics thrown at the public by
daily reporting of covid cases and covid deaths was absolutely disgusting and I will never forget my disgust at the
words spoken by the now ex-premier Palashuz saying that the unvaccinated were the pandemic. How disgusting
to turn people against each other, to alienate families, to deny medical treatment to those who chose not to be
vaccinated, to effectively put into place^^^^H The total disregard to people in not getting informed consent,
the medical doctors being threatened with loss of their licences and the taking away of the doctor/patient
relationship was never right. This should never, ever be remotely considered if ever there is another pandemic.

I am opposed to the removal of our freedoms by government in the form of mask mandates, vaccine mandates,
lockdowns and curfews and our nation deserves a real covid inquiry that will look into all aspects of how the
pandemic was handled. In fact, there should be punishments enforced on those who acted in such an abhorent
manner to the citizens of this country. We were violated, our businesses, our careers, our ability to earn an
income and provide for our families was taken away.

Thank you.
