To whom it may concern,

In the interests of transparency and full accountability and restoring public trust, please ensure the
Commission conducts a thorough and proper investigation into the following:

• Vaccine procurement and contracts - full transparency is required as to the process, the decision
  makers and the publishing of all contracts
• Financial incentive tracking in regards to vaccine provider selection and procurement
• The role of pharmaceutical lobbyists
• PCR test effectiveness
• Mask mandates and mask effectiveness
• Lock downs and damage caused by lock downs
• Vaccine mandates
• Vaccine injuries
• Excess deaths after vaccine rollout
• The role of the media in creating divisions between Australians with denigrating language (anti-
  vaxxer etc)
• Suppression of alternative options and early treatments
• Censorship of alternative points of view, lack of open discussion and debate
• Official misinformation regarding the ability of vaccine effectiveness i.e. to block transmission
• Censiorship of doctors
• The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship of medical practitioners
• The role of WHO in influencing or setting policies in Australia


The public has a right to transparency on these issues in order to help restore trust in our
institutions.

Thank you.
