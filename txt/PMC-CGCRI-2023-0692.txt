I have first hand experience of friends who had bad side effects after they received the
covid vaccine.
1. One had severe vomiting and diarrhoea and thought he had eaten contaminated food.
He had a booster shot, and had the same reaction, and realised that the first bout was
after his initial injection
2. This friend had the vaccine and when he returned home, he blacked out. He was unable
to speak and was hospitalised in intensive care for a week. It took about one month for his
body to recover.
