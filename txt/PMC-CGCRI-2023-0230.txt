COVID-19 RESPONSE INQUIRY

Greetings

I work at a state school providing student wellbeing support, and have done so for more
than nine years.

In late 2021 my cousin died after receiving a covid-19 vaccine. I watched his funeral online.

I contacted my local federal member who assured me that vaccines would not be
mandatory.

My employer then informed me that I was required to have two doses of a vaccine before
returning to work. We now know that these vaccines neither prevented contraction of the
disease or transmission of the disease.

Broader health and social supports/ Governance:

Health and support workers were banned from providing essential services, at a time they
were most needed, because they believed their own health was at risk from a mandated
vaccine! Please don't do that ever again.

Key health response measures:

Trusted local doctors were threatened then legislated against for using their expertise in
treating their patients with safe and trusted medications!

Rather than broad based health and wellbeing advice, the government dictated a very
narrow fear-based mantra, so the community had little idea of how to manage the
contraction of the disease.

My students educational and social progress were severely disrupted by 'lock-downs'.




thanks for considering this submission
