Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry Submission
                                                              Anonymous Victorian Resident
                                                                                15/12/2023


The Commonwealth inquiry into the government’s response to COVID-19 is an absolute joke
as the submission period for the public is only one week and right before Christmas, and
also excludes the unilateral actions by the states that constitute the Commonwealth.
This shows the Commonwealth Government’s contempt for the people of Australia and that
the government does not take this inquiry seriously.
I am a resident of Victoria and a survivor of the longest lockdowns in the world under former
Premier Daniel Andrews.
Under Mr Andrews and the Australian Government’s oppressive, unwarranted, draconian,
undemocratic, so-called health directives, I was subjected to:
   •       Psychological and mental effects and distress.
   •       Isolation from family and friends.
   •   Erosion of trust and confidence in the government and the police force. I will now
       struggle to trust or respect any members of these bodies ever again.
   •       The ‘ring of steel’ separating Melbourne from rural Victoria.
   •   Having to travel with a ‘pass’ and not being allowed to have free movement within my
       state.
   •       The permanent destruction of millions of jobs and businesses.
   •   The secret National Cabinet that won’t release the minutes of any meetings over the
       past three and half years. Where is the transparency?
   •       Unemployment and prejudice from businesses due to the vaccine mandates.
   •       My^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^who lives alone, is alienated from her own family.
   •   My church being forcibly closed upon threat of arrest and fines while brothels were
       allowed to continue business.
   •   Unelected health bureaucrats and ‘authorised officials’ threatening to invade private
       homes and businesses under health ‘directives’ and ‘other purposes’ (as per the
       pandemic bill brought into Victoria in 2020).
   •   Vaccine mandates: Even though there was sufficient evidence the vaccines did not
       stop transmission or infection, the vaccines had severe side effects, and the
       vaccinated could still spread the virus. This is a violation of human rights and bodily
       autonomy. No government should ever be able to mandate a medical procedure.
   •   Daily media propaganda perpetuating fear of an invisible virus, ‘cases’, ‘deaths’,
       ‘variants’.
   •   The treatment by the government and the brainwashing of the Victorian people to
       shun the ‘unvaccinated’ and regard them as lepers and segregate them from society.
   •   The continued blatant arrogance in ignoring and banning tried and tested scientific
       treatments, methods, data and evidence in favour of experimental pharmaceutical
       products. This is a violation of the rights of Australians to access medical care.
   •   Censoring educated, qualified scientists and medical professionals in favour of the
       unelected World Health Organisation officials.
   •   The brutalisation of specific public protests and marches, but allowing other protests
       (BLM) to continue without police involvement.
   •   The closure of education facilities and students forced to study online. Working in an
       education facility, I witnessed first-hand the severe deterioration of students’ mental
       health and learning abilities in students as young as three years old.
   •   ANZAC Day and Australia Day marches cancelled while sports events, an ‘Invasion
       Day’ protest, and celebrations for Chinese New Year were allowed to continue.
I hope the Commonwealth Government will pay attention to the Australian people’s
submissions and hold those responsible accountable for their decisions and the resulting
deaths and human rights violations. You, the Commonwealth Government, are elected by
the people, for the people.
