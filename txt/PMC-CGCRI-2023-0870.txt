The immune system needs at least 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin
D in order to function properly - Submission from Robin Whittle
This submission to the COVID-19 Response Enquiry addresses the key health response measures which Federal
and State governments should have implemented in order to suppress COVID-19 transmission, harm and death -
and should implement now and in the future for this and numerous other reasons.

I am an electronic technician and computer programmer in Daylesford, Victoria. Since early 2020 I have been
raising awareness of the immune system's need for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels well above the ca. 50 nmol/L (20
ng/mL) level which is sufficient for the kidneys to regulate calcium-phosphate-bone metabolism. This is critically
important for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 and many other illnesses.

I established the Nutrition for Immune System Health (NISH) email discussion list nish.groups.io and I am part of
an informal, international, group of researchers, doctors and advocates who have long been trying to raise
awareness of the need for adequate 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, with the COVID-19 pandemic making this a matter
of life and death for millions of people.

Please read the research articles cited and discussed at: vitamindstopscovid.info/  evi/, This was a submission
to a UK government inquiry (co-signed by^^^^^^^^^^MD, Hawaii).            Robin Whittle 2023-12-14

Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D increases COVID-19 severity, transmission and risk of serious harm and death
        This box and whiskers graph is from^Het al. 2022 https://doi.orq/10.1371 /journal.pone.0263069 . It
        shows that the lower the pre-infection 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is (as measured in "vitamin D" blood
        tests) the greater the severity of COVID-19. Severity drives increased viral shedding and so transmission.




        The histograms from^^|et al. 2020 www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101 /2020.09.04.20188268v1 depict
        the prevalence of different levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in sunny Israel. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of
        white skinned people in the southern Australian states, who do not properly supplement vitamin D, during
        winter, would be significantly lower. The elderly, those with dark or black skin and those with sun-avoidant
        lifestyle (e.g. Muslim women in Australia and Israel) often have levels below 25 nmol/L - 20% of what their
        immune system needs. Vitamin D researcher and Head, Department of Medicine, Monash University,
                                                                                                                       1
Professor               raised these concerns in August 2020 regarding the darker skinned immigrants in
Victoria who then were suffering the highest rates of COVID-19 transmission, hospitalisation and death:
www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/healthreport/is-there-a-link-between-vitamin-d-and-
coronavirus/12566324.

The green area of the graph depicts levels of 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL, 1 part in 20,000,000 by mass) and
above, which are needed by many types of immune cell, in order to properly supply their intracrine (inside
each cell) and paracrine (to nearby cells) signaling systems. These signaling systems are crucial to the
ability of individual immune cells to alter their behaviour in response to their changing circumstances.
Since no peer-reviewed journal article provides a tutorial explanation of these systems, and since they must
be understood by all doctors and immunologists, I wrote such a tutorial: vitamindstopscovid.info/00-
evi/#02-compounds .

Neither vitamin D3 cholecalciferol nor 25-hydroxyvitamin D calcifediol function as hormones. The immune
system does not use hormonal signaling. 25-hydroxyvitamin D is produced, over several days, in the liver
from vitamin D3 which is either ingested or produced in ideally white skin by extensive ultraviolet B
exposure.

Since 2008, leading researchers and medical doctors (many are both) have been calling for 100 to 150
nmol/L (40 to 60 ng/mL) to be recognised as the level of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D which is
necessary for good health: www.qrassrootshealth.net/project/our-scientists/.

The most direct evidence of immun^ystem dysfunction increasing the further the 25-hydroxyvitamin D
level fall below 125 ng/mL is^^^| et al. 2014 iamanetwork.com/iournals/iamasurgery/fullarticle/
1782085, PDF: sci-hub.se/10.1001 /iamasurq.2013.3176 Morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric
bypass surgery for weight loss at Massachusetts General Hospital had a 30% risk of hospital acquired
infections and a 30% risk of surgical site infections if their 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was about 40 nmol/L
(16 ng/mL). This is not far below the 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) required for proper kidney regulation of
calcium-phosphate-bone metabolism, which is all most doctors and government supplemental vitamin D3
recommendations aim to attain.

Yet the risk of each type of infection falls to about 2.5% at 125 nmol/L and above. While people suffering
from obesity have lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels than normal for any given vitamin D3 supplemental
intake as a ratio of body weight 5nn.info/temp/250hd-obesity/, there is no reason to believe their immune
systems need a higher level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to function properly than do normal weight people.

New Jersey based Emeritus Professor of Medicine,PhD, MBA, DSc, (CV) has been
researching vitamin D since the mid-1990s. He told me that the most common response by doctors to
research such as the above is: "How can it be true? It is too simple." Most medical doctors,
immunologists and epidemiologists pay far too little attention to research on vitamin D and other nutrients.
It is true, simple and of overriding importance to all aspects of health that most people need to supplement
                                                                                                                                    2
vitamin D3 properly in order to attain the 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) or more level of circulating 25-
hydroxyvitamin D which their immune systems need to function properly.

In 2022, Professor^^^^^^Mprovided the first peer reviewed recommendation for vitamin D3
supplemental intake quantities to safely attain this healthy level of 25-hydroxytivamin D, without requiring
blood tests or medical monitoring: Rapidly Increasing Serum 25(OH)D Boosts the Immune System,
against Infections - Sepsis and COVID-19 Nutrients 2022-07-21 www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/14/2997.
In a recent webinar
odysee.eom/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Weeekly Webinar Auq16 2023:d?t=3386 he
simplified his recommendations for average daily vitamin D3 intakes:
        70 to 90 IU / kg body weight for those not suffering from obesity (BMI < 30).
        100 to 130 IU / kg body weight for obesity I & II (BMI 30 to 39).
        140 to 180 IU / kg body weight for obesity III (BMI > 39).
So a 70 kg non-obese person should supplement around 49C to 6300 lUs a day on average. Please do
not be alarmed by these high numbers: one IU of vitamin D3 is 1/40,000,000th of a gram. 5000 IU (0.125
milligrams) a day is a gram every 22 years, and pharma-grade vitamin D3 costs about USD$2.50 a gram
ex-factory. This is the only way most people's immune system can function properly. The Australian
government vitamin D recommendations aim to attain only 27.5 nmol/L (11 ng/mL) circulating 25-
hydroxyvitamin D: www.eatforhealth.qov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/vitamin-d. Daily vitamin D3
intake recommendations are : 1 to 50 years: 0.05 mg 200 IU; 51 to 70 years: 0.01 mg 400 IU and 70+ years:
0.015 mg 600 IU. The largest capacity D3 capsules Australian retailers can sell are 0.025 mg 1000 IU.

Professor ^^^^^^Halso recommends the most important early treatment for the great majority of
COVID-19 patients, whose 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are a fraction of 125 nmol/L 50 ng/mL. Rather than
use a single bolus dose of vitamin D3, such as 10 mg 400,000 IU, which takes several days to raise 25-
hydroxyvitamin D over 125 nmol/L due to the delays of hydroxylation in the liver, he recommends a single
oral dose of 0 )4 milligrams calcifediol, which is 25-hydroxyvitamin D, per kg body weight. This is 1 mg
for average weight adults, and raises circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D safely over 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) in
about 4 hours. The crucial importance of rapidly boosting this level in hospitalised COVID-19 patients has
been known since August 202C ^^|et al. www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/
S0960I 76020302Z64 in which a single oral dose of 0.566 mg of calcifediol in hospitalised COVID-19
patients was the primary reason for ICU admissions dropping from 50% to 2% and deaths from 8% to zero.

However, most doctors are far too enamoured of the promises made for vaccines, monoclonal antibodies
and expensive, patented, anti-virals to take a proper interest in nutrition and the fact that most people's
immune system is crippled to a potentially large extent by insufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

In 2021,^^^Het al. www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021 -01080-3 elucidated the role of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D based intracrine (they called it autocrin^ signaling in Thl regulatory lymphocytes. An
inadequate supply of this compound was the primary or sole reason for Thl cells from the lungs of
hospitalised patients remaining stuck in their pro-inflammatory startup program, never transitioning to their
anti-inflammatory shutdown program, despite detecting the condition to do so: a high level of a
complement protein. If these people had had 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) 25-hydroxyvitamin D when infected,
they would probably not have had such severe infection and inflammation as to require hospitalisation.

The research cited in these three pages, shows that a great deal of human ill-health, and millions of deaths
worldwide from COVID-19, could have been greatly reduced with 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) or more
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There is very little vitamin D3 in food - fortified or not - or in
multivitamins, so a "balanced diet" is insufficient for good health. White skinned people can generate
sufficient vitamin D for immune system health with extensive UV-B skin exposure. However, this is only
available naturally on cloud-free summer days - and UV-B damages DNA and raises the risk of skin cancer.

The Australian public relies on the federal government to support the best measures which ensure general
health and proper early treatment of all diseases, especially COVID-19. The government needs to look
beyond the blinkered view of the majority of the medical profession and support the public according to the
best research. Please read the best of this research yourselves: vitamindstopscovid.info/ 0-evi.

Adequate 25-hydroxyvitamin D can be attained easily with proper vitamin D3 supplementation. This is
important for numerous reasons, including suppressing the transmission and/or severity of a very large
number of health conditions, including: sepsis, COVID-19, Kawasaki disease, MIS-C, influenza. In utero
#3.2: autism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, ADHD, low birth weight pre-eclampsia. In old age #3.3:
most or all forms of dementia, including Parkinson's disease. Numerous auto-immune diseases, including
MS, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are worsened by low 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
