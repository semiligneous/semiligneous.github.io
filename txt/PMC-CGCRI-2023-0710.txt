I, like so many thousands of others, was unable to continue in my work (as a home care worker, in my
case) as a result of the vaccine mandates (which could have been stopped by federal government
intervention), suffering financial harm as a result.



The vaccine mandates were manifestly unnecessary as the vaccines (so-called) did absolutely nothing to
stop transmission of Covid.



While I could understand the push for people to get vaccinated against their will if it achieved something
by protecting others, it did not.



The many harms caused by the vaccines are widely known and the people who forced them on the
population should be held to account.



Lies and false statistics and information abounded. A friend of a friend's wife passed away of something
completely unrelated and the husband was asked by doctors if he would like records to show that she
died of Covid. Was there a financial incentive for this??



Media coverage was alarmist and relentless, causing fear out of proportion to the threat.



Lockdowns were crippling and out of proportion, causing severe distress, financial harm etc to many
people and achieving nothing.



In summary, I would say the federal government's response to Covid, especially in its reluctance to
ensure state governments acted in a manner that could be justified by results, was completely
unsatisfactory.
