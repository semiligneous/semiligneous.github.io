Dear participants into the Commonwealth Government's response to COVID 19,



My name is James toohey, a retired electrical engineer.

The Commonwealth Government's response has been at the outset one of coercion and fear to force
compliance to their wish for everyone to submit to a vaccination regime that was experimental and
poorly tested with new technology that is really gene therapy.

The government's actions have violated my rights as defined by the United Nations' charter of
human rights as specifically stated in section of the Nurenberg convention.

It has impacted on my ability to move freely in society in the pursuit of my daily life.

As part of an art initiative, I had the opportunity/misfortune to read the stories of nearly 600
wo/men who showed devastating medical symptoms shortly after receiving the COVID mRNA
injection that was supposed to be safe and effective!

Data from all countries' health departments show the devastating effect these injections have had on
large amounts of people.

The elderly should have been protected, the young and healthy who's risk of dying from COVID was
minute, should have just gone on with their lives instead of lockdowns, divisions in families and
friends.

The mental health fallout, the isolation, separation and division from the last three years has not
even been fully realised yet.

I urge this committee to urge the government of the day to implement tailor made strategies that are
relevant to the Australian people instead of taking the recommendations of unelected bureaucrats as
the only guidelines without critical analysis of the implications of such decisions on the wider
populus.



Thank you for your time.



Yours sincerely

James toohey
