I’m writing in relation to federal government’s covid ‘inquiry’, noting I do not have high hopes
for the inquiry, given it does not intend to investigate the actions of the States, despite all the
destruction caused by state governments across the nation.

THE TRASHING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE END OF INFORMED CONSENT

I am a Solicitor. When I was admitted, I had to make an oath to uphold the rule of law. I have
been completely aghast watching fellow lawyers all around me, from the most senior, to the
most junior, keep their mouths shut (out of fear of being labelled an ‘anti-vaxxer’) while their
fellow citizens had their innate civil liberties stripped from them, by the state and for lengthy
periods of time, for simply not submitting to an experimental medical procedure that, for the
vast majority of Australians, they simply didn’t need. The risks did not out way the benefits,
as the science showed at the time, and unfortunately continues to show.

The most basic understanding of the rule of law centres around the idea of equality before the
law, for all citizens. If I have a right as an Australian citizen, so do you. But not in vaccine
mandate Australia. You could not live your life in any sort of normal way, could not dine out,
could not visit a hospital, could not (sit outside!) at a sporting event, could not go to a wake,
could not go to a wedding, if you were unvaccinated. Even worse, hundreds of thousands of
Australians had a to make a choice between taking an experimental medical product they
didn’t need or want and putting food on the table for their families. It was all coercion. Submit,
or have your lives effectively stripped from you. The idea of informed consent, we have now
learnt, means absolutely nothing in this country.

Your civil liberties, in any democracy, are innate, and are not handed out to you by the
state, as a reward for being a compliant citizen.

The mandates were illiberal, and undemocratic. The current federal government does not
want to investigate the states in this inquiry, because the result would be so catastrophic to
the Labor party.

THE PRINCIPLE OF BODILY AUTOMINY, THROWN OUT THE WINDOW

I have also found it extremely perplexing that the most left wing politicians among us tout the
principle of bodily autonomy as sacred when it comes to abortion, and a woman’s right to
choose, yet do not have the mental bandwidth to realise that the vaccine mandates completely
violated this principal. You either believe in the principle of bodily autonomy, or you don’t.
And, it is clear, most of the left wing politicians in this country, really don’t.

THE INJURIES TO SO MANY AUSTRALIANS

My firm acts for several different practices of cardiologists. Since October 2021 all of the
cardiologists we act for have confirmed to me that none of their own children or family
members have taken the shots, due to the immense number of injuries the cardiologists were
seeing, day in day out.

Two weeks ago, another cardiologist came into the office about




It is absolutely unbelievable that Chief Health Officers (who, unelected, wielded so much
power throughout the pandemic) are still recommending these failed products.

Personally, given I mostly practice in^^^^Hl want to put on the record that during the first
booster campaign in early 2022,1 had^^^^Hcome in, within a period of three weeks, where
the cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest. These people dropped dead on the spot, with
no history of heart problems. Several of them were younger men. Some of the families,
unprompted, told me they thought it was the shots. I couldn’t bring myself to mention it to the
other families. In the normal course of a year, our firm might see^^^^^| where someone
has died suddenly like that - but this was           within a three week period, during the first
booster campaign.

TGA CAPTURE

The incredibly number of injuries and the varied nature of the same (cardiac events, strokes,
blood clots, auto immune issues, brain inflammation, an increase in the number of cancers,
menstrual effects, the list literally goes on and on and on) would, one would think, prompt the
TGA to pull these ineffective and unsafe products from the market.

Not in Australia though. This would be perplexing, however perhaps the fact that the vast
majority of the TGA’s funding comes directly from pharmaceutical companies explains it. If
your inquiry does one thing, it needs to recommend that this practice ends. It has brought
death and injury to tens of thousands of Australians and it continues to compromise the health
of Australians across the nation.

Doctors across the nation have been scared to speak out, scared to be labelled ‘anti vaxxers’,
scared to speak only with their patients about the risks associated with the shots, and this has
prevented doctor’s from complying with the fiduciary duties they owe, legally, to their patients.

This has completely eroded the principle of informed consent - an essential principle of
medicine.

THE MISINFORMATION HAS COME FROM THE GOVERNMENT

The unfortunate reality is that the vast majority of medical misinformation in relation to the
pandemic has come directly from government sources.

I note the efficacy of vaccines has declined considerably, so much so that the New England
Journal of Medicine confirmed negative vaccine efficacy against omicron. New research is
regularly highlighting alarming safety issues with the vaccines. A small sample of this
research is linked below for your perusal, including in relation to the effects of the MRNA shots
on sperm counts, DNA, breast milk, the immune system, and case numbers in general. The
Florida Surgeon General, recommended against vaccination for 18 - 39 year old men and
based that decision on analysis that found an 84% increase in the relative incidence of
cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA
vaccination. Recently it has come to light that there is DNA contamination on a massive
scale in the MRNA shots.

The reality of the MRNA shots is that are not fit for purpose. They are grossly unsafe and
completely ineffective. They need to be removed from the market without any further delay.

EXCESS MORTALITY

I also note ABS mortality figures showed an almost 20% increase in mortality last year (this
figure is still hugely elevated from the expected level), across Australia, which increase
requires immediate investigation and to date, has been unexplained by the government.

How many press conferences did we have to witness in the early days, when one person died
of covid. Yet thousands of extra deaths are occurring every week now, and have since the
vaccine rollout (even in WA when their were shots, but no covid yet), and yet the government
is not interested.

If the federal government was truly concerned about the health of Australians, then they would
launch a legitimate investigation into the excess death rate across the nation. And they would
do so without any further delay.
