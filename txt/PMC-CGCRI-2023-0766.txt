I have serious concerns about the COVID 19 mandates and policies that have
been trialed in Australia.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) assessed the COVID 19 global trial
experimental vaccines and recorded serious safety concerns. They also
identified important risks ahead of the jab rollout in Australia. These three
publicly available reports were obviously ignored by the TGA at the time.

These safety warnings were ignored by the Australian health departments in
all states. These states could not have implemented their coersive COVID
policies without the support and endorsement of the federal government.

Within weeks of the jab rollout in Australia, and also over many months,
thousands of serious side-effect cases were reported along with many deaths
to both children and adults across the country. Refer to TGA DAEN websites
as evidence.

Therefore, I recommend that the federal government: -

1. Stops advertising the jabs as 'safe and effective';
2. Halts the jab recomendations which are clearly doing more harm than good;
3. Stops all conflict of interests involving funds being given from big Pharma
to TGA and governments, etc;
4. Stops giving legal indemnity to pharmaceutical companies, and rolls it back
to before the trials started;
5. Ensures proper and easier compensation channels for the jab-injured and
their families;
6. And, as the Pfizer trial ends in December 2023, 1 recommend that the
federal government immediately publishes the findings publicly on all media
platforms to inform the people of the trial outcomes.
