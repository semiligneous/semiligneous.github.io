I would like to see a full royal commission with powers to question any person in Australia on the
following topics:

    •   Payments to individuals, businesses and government departments to push certain agendas
        related to vaccines, lockdowns, mask-wearing, etc
    •       All details of contracts with the COVID vaccine manufacturers
    •   Exposure of those individuals who authorised vaccine mandates, mask-wearing, lockdowns,
        etc and what they based their decisions on
    •   Details of contracts / agreements with social media companies and legacy media companies
        to push the official narrative of "safe & effective" and also withhold alternative treatment
        information such as ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, etc, or to cancel or ridicule those who
        suggested alternative treatments
    •   Why the vaccine rollout wasn't stopped or even paused once there was an indication of
        possible harms (including up to death) being done by the vaccines and also once it became it
        became know that the vaccine may not stop getting COVID or transmitting COVID. And then
        investigation as to why the vaccine rollout was not totally stopped once it was obvious (e.g.
        excess deaths) that the vaccines were causing harms to people
    •   What basis were all the lockdown, social-distancing and mask wearing rules were put in
        place, especially once it became obvious they were at best ineffective and at worst
        catastrophic
    •   Who authorised the state border lockdowns and on what basis that were implemented by
        most states, which as far as I can tell, is against the Australian Constitution
    •   Who authorised the silencing, censorship & even deregistration of medical professionals who
        raised questions about the efficacy of the COVID vaccines or who went against the official
        government narrative by suggesting alternative treatments
    •   Penalties (fines and jail time) for people in power (politicians, bureaucrats, etc) who have
        been found to have acted against the law and/or against the Australian Constitution,
        according to what is uncovered from the points above
