The Panel
Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Paragraphs 8 & 9, Part 2 of Northern Territory COVID-19 Directions (No. 55) 2021 as amended by COVID-19 Directions
(No.81) 2021 stated:




The evidence required for direction 8 above was a certificate issued by the Commonwealth that certifies that the
worker has a permanent or temporary contraindication to all approved COVID-19 vaccines, (see Appendix 2) The
guidelines for obtaining that certificate were outlined in the ATAGI guidelines:

19-vaccine-in-australia-in-2021.pdf
https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/fiiles/documents/2021/10/atagi-expanded-guidance-on-temporary-
medicalexemptions-for-covid-19-vaccines.pdf

The Guidelines stated that there are



                                                                                                              The
Guidelines also state that only temporary exemptions could be issued, and if the existing conditions that would
potentially be triggered by the injection were not within a very narrow range of conditions, then Temporary
Exemptions could only "rarely" be given if
                                                 occurred. By implication, to obtain an exemption from the injections
on the grounds that death is one of the known adverse reactions to the injections, you have to die from a COVID-19
injection to obtain the Temporary Exemption from the vaccine. This is unconscionable and ludicrous. According to
VAERS, the principal government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccination responses in the United States,
there were 28,859 reported deaths as of 23 June, 2022. How could anyone know that they would not be the 28,860th
person to die after receiving the injection. As of the 27th May, 2022 "16% of the 13,150 deaths (that had been
reported up to that point in time) in the United States occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 20% within 48 hours of
vaccination, and 59% occurred in those who had symptoms within 48 hours of vaccination"
Data).

I obtained a copy of the list of over 1,200+ adverse reactions known by                                    This
list included conditions that both myself and other members of my family were susceptible to. Without informed
consent we were pressured to be exposed to unknown ingredients in the injections that had the potential of causing
severe and life-threatening reactions in myself and in the other members of my family, for whom I am responsible.
