Call for submissions and evidence to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

The COVID-19 Response Inquiry Panel invites interested people and
organisations to make a submission and/or provide evidence to inform
recommendations that aim to improve Australiaâ€™s preparedness for
future pandemics.




I am a teacher and have worked with the                                       for almost 20 years.
In 2022, I was sacked for misconduct when I chose not to get an experimental covid
injection.

The Australian Federal government failed to protect my right to choose which medical
treatments I have by failing to introduce anti-discrimination legislation (COVID-19
Vaccination Status (Prevention of Discrimination) Bill 2022 and the Fair Work Amendment
(Prohibiting COVID-19 Vaccine Discrimination) Bill 2023. These Bills still seem to be before
the senate.

According to the Nuremberg Code (1947): The voluntary consent of the human subject is
absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give
consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the
intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior
form of constraint or coercion;

Threatening my livelihood was coercion. Forcing my children to get injected or they could
not attend university was coercion.

In failing to introduce the above Bills, you have failed to protect your citizens' civil rights and
you have failed to uphold the Nuremburg code.

If you aim to improve Australia's preparedness for future pandemics, then there will not be
any excuses for failing to uphold basic human rights.
