COVID-19 Inquiry

To whom it may concern,

As this COVID-19 response was one of the most significant events to happen in Australia, and its
ramifications and effects on people, business and the economy was so extensive, I feel that it
behoves the Government to hold a proper Royal Commission into the COVID-19 response by the
Federal Government, National Cabinet, and the disparate responses by the various States.

I believe also that the current Government is showing contempt for the Australian public, by only
having an inquiry into the COVID-19 response, and putting such a small timeframe for submissions.

The following are areas that need to be properly investigated and reported on to give the Australian
public any confidence that this inquiry is not just a deliberate white-wash:

    •       Corrupt vaccine procurements, and secret contracts;
    •       Mask mandates
    •   Official misinformation - that the COVID-19 trial drugs were safe & effective; and deliberate
        blocking of information of those who were offering different medical alternatives;
    •   Lies that these trial vaccines would block transmission - promulgated by both media and
        government;
    •       Doctor and other medical personnel being gagged and censored by AHPRA & ATAGI;
    •       Human rights being set aside - such as bodily autonomy choices; right to protest; etc.
    •       Role of approval of the trial vaccines by TGA - especially relying solely on FDA approval,
        when FDA relied on Phizer/Moderna trials without their own testing;
    •       Mandates in various states for a range of industries;
    •       Excess deaths in Australia that have not been investigated;
    •       Vaccine injuries that have occurred, and the lack of true compensation for those affected;
    •       Decisions to implement lockdowns, and their length of time and effects;
    •       Health directives by the relevant authorities and their basis.
    •       Role of police enforcement of heath directives;

These are just some of the areas that come to mind that need to be investigated. I urge the inquiry
to direct the Government to investigate these areas and more, so that the Australian public will be
convinced that lessons from this era in our nation will be learnt and implemented to ensure that the
devastation caused by an infection that was only slightly worse than the yearly influenza infections
does not repeat itself.

Yours sincerely,
