From March 2020-June 2023
The Governments handling of the Pandemic was atrocious,
provide the following reasons to substantiate this.

I lived in Melbourne VIC witMm^amily under^^^^^Dan Andrews, Labor
Government who incited^^^^Htowards the people by             the Police
and Military.

My^^^l and I attended various peaceful protests in                         and other
areas during which time I witnessed Police/Military being instructed to:

   1.     Shoot peaceful protesters with rubber bullets
   2. Intimidate and harass public citizens taking a walk without masks even
      though they were social distancing
   3. Road-block major highways and motorways to restrict travel and movement
      during the pandemic
   4.     Kettle, pepper spray and arrest peaceful protesters in forceful manner
   5. Military knocked on my door to check if
      were isolating in my home
   6.     Turn Victoria into a Totalitarian State.

Other incidents I witnessed in VIC during the^^^^^^Bincluded:


   •     Medical apartheid - Vaccinated VS Unvaccinated____
   •   Unvaccinated labelled as Conspiracy Theorists by ^^^Hoan Andrews
       publicly during conferences
   •   Unvaccinated prohibited from entering restaurants, movies, medical
       centres, public places without showing a valid vaccination cert.
   •   Businesses brought to their knees and closed their doors permanently due
       to unnecessary extended lockdowns implemented by ^^^Hoan
       Andrews.
   •   Social Media Censorship / Shadow banning - profiles, comments and posts
       removed/deleted. Fake accounts and Bots deployed to shut down
       discussion/opinions.
   •       People being arrested for exercising their right to freedom of speech.
   •   Novak Djokovic held in a hotel and banned from playing the Australian
       Open. Poor immigration system who tried to embarrass an unvaccinated
       elite athlete. That backfired!

The Federal and State Governments, Minister Gallagher/TGA, APRHA & ATAGI
must be held responsible for their role in this^^^^^^H also:
    1. They all advocated for People to take a Covid Vaccine that is safe and
       effective as publicly announced through various media channels. This is
       NOT true it is a lie - the vaccinated suffer the most infections.
    2. The TGA, APRHA and ATAGI maintained their lies that the Covid Vaccine
       will stop infection and transmission - this did not happen even after jab #4
       or #5.
    3. APRHA forced Medical Professionals to push the vaccine onto their
       patients in the name of Public Health. They silenced, interrogated,
       cancelled and deregistered Medical Professionals who did not advocate for
       the Covid Vaccine based on their patients histopathology and other
       medical conditions.
    4. The ingredients and potential side effects of the vaccines were not allowed
       to be openly discussed between Medical Professionals and patients nor
       was this information made available to any patients.
    5. Big Pharma Manufacturers were given indemnity for any vaccine injuries -
       this was not disclosed to the people of Australia.
    6. The slogan in Victoria was "Keep your family safe", "Keep your
       grandparents safe", "Keep your community safe" what a load of^|
    7. When questioned on the efficacy of the vaccine Minister Gallagher and
       other Bureaucrats refer to the "Commercial in Confidence" Contract with
       Big Pharma therefore do not answer any questions with clarity or certainty.

The People of Australia want these Bureaucrats held to account, trialled and
imprisoned for their complicit involvement with harming the Australian People for
Profit. These Bureaucrats are answerable to the People of Australia, our taxpayer
funds pay their wages! If they cannot answer these questions then they should
have their wages reduced to NIL while they are held on Trial for CRIMES AGAINST
HUMANITY. All the Premiers who resigned during and after this                must
return for Trial and prison sentences also.

The people of Australia want a Royal Commission for a proper investigation into;
corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts; mask mandates; lock downs;
vaccine mandates, official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the
ability of vaccines to block transmission/infection, vaccine injuries; media
censorship, silencing of doctors, the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and
oppression of doctors, and the poor treatment of vaccine injured victims. The role
of the Federal and State Governments, TGA and Health Ministers in advocating for
a Trial Vaccine that indemnifies the manufacturers.
