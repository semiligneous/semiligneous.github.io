Submission for the Covid Inquiry from the Office of the PM & Cabinet 2023

https://www.pmc.gov.au/covid-19-response-inquiry/consultation

   •   Covid 19 vaccine procurement and secret contracts
           o Why can't the Australian public see the contracts between the
               pharmaceuticals and the Australian government?
           o Why the How many vaccines have been purchased, how many used and
               how many wasted?
   •   Mask mandates: Helpful or harmful? Government appointed scientists state
       masks help the spread & prevent infections, independent scientists/doctors have
       proven that masks don't help, but certainly make a presence and reinforce fear.
   •   Lock downs: Today and always for that matter the advice to strengthen your
       immune system especially against viruses is to be outside (vitamin D). Keeping
       people inside during lock downs, naturally challenged the majority of people,
       especially children mentally (for many years to come looking at the increased
       number in mental health cases), but also ‘weakened’ their immune system.
       When people were allowed to be outside again (after being vaccinated with safe
       & effective vaccines), and the borders opened, the majority of people were very
       sick from viruses and hospitalizations went through the roof. Either not an
       effective vaccine or people suffered from being locked down? What was the
       cause?
   •   Vaccine mandates: Vaccine doesn't stop transmission. Why were mandates
       implemented?
           o "No one will be safe until everyone is vaccinated." Pfizer admitted to MEP
               Rob Roos that they never tested if the jab stopped transmission. The
               vaccines didn't stop transmission.
           o Why were employees made redundant if they didn't take the not so
               effective vaccine which was evident very shortly after the vaccine roll out.
           o The government kept with the same message advertising on mainstream
               media: “Get vaccinated to protect others" why? People were made to feel
               safe where they shouldn't have. Misinformation?
           o Vaccinated, yet tested positive people were able to move around freely, yet
               they were passing the virus on. Again, this was evident very early on, yet
               no changes were made:

   •   Vaccine injuries:
          o https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dr-robert-malone-red-pills-members-uk-
             parliament-4-major-agostino-fnlgeOfficial misinformation and lies in the
             media regarding the ability of vaccines to block transmission.

   •   Excess death:
          o Australia has a unique scenario regarding being able to pinpoint a direct
              correlation between no covid appearing in Australia from May 2021. During
              the same time (March 2021) the rollout of Covid 19 vaccines started with
              the goal to vaccinate all “willing" people by 2022.

          o   The excess deaths started to rise in 2022 and continue to rise in 2023. See

       o   Connections between specific COVID-19 vaccine batches and mortality
           rates. Has this been done in Australia?

       o   Never in history, have we had excess deaths after a pandemic. There are
           more people dying now than during the pandemic, even though 95% of
           the population got vaccinated. Safe & effective was the mantra given out
           by the government and mainstream media - a lie?

                 a.      Data is provisional and subject to change.
                 b. Years are based on a sum of ISO weeks derived from the weekly modelling. There are 53 weeks in 2020. There are 52 weeks in 2021 and 2022.
                 Excess mortality has been estimated for the first 12 weeks of 2023.
                 c. Deaths in 2023 are deaths that occurred by 26 March and were registered and received by the ABS by 31 May 2023.

       o   The percentage of dying people is much higher amongst vaccinated
           people. Since then, the vaccination status of dying people hasn't been
           recorded. Today we don't know whether the high death rate is amongst
           vaccinated or not vaccinated population.
       o   The excess death rate is higher not because of people dying with or Covid.
           So, why are there so many people dying. The excess deaths are higher
           than during the pandemic and no-one is asking questions.

•   False recording of actual Covid Deaths during the pandemic. Numbers of people
    dying of Covid, were much lower than recorded. NSW government confirmed in
    2021 that numbers of Covid Deaths were recorded as ‘died with & of Covid' yet the
    released numbers were ‘marketed’ as died of Covid in the initial stages of the
    pandemic and not rectified officially. The public doesn't know about this till
    today.
•   Media censorship: People who didn't believe in the narrative were silenced.
    Labelled as conspiracy theorists, right wing and therefore cancelled. We will in a
    democratic country, censorship should never happen, under any circumstance.
    It's our right to free speech. Why did this happen?
•   Restricting free speech worldwide:

•   Nobel prize winning medical products such as Ivermectin were not available
    during the pandemic and labelled as ‘dangerous horse dewormer' by the
    mainstream media. Since the prodigious drug donation operation began in 1987,
    1.5 billion treatments have been approved and with over 112.7 million people being
    successfully treated yearly.
         o With an early treatment proven to be working reducing the symptoms of
              Covidl9, emergency powers couldn't have been implemented.
         o Ivermectin was administered in many countries during the Covid
              pandemic and proven to be effective:

•   Silencing of doctors & stripping medical registration from doctors who didn't
    agree with the medical approach/protocol during the pandemic. The role of
    AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors.
•   University of QLD were given government grant to rush through a safe & effective
    C19 vaccine. It failed their first trial. Vaxine (lead by Sharen Petrovsky) produced a
    safe & effective protein-based Covax-19 vaccine yet the Australian government
    turned a blind eye and put roadblocks wherever they could. It's the first synthetic
    protein vaccine against Covid-19 to receive market authorisation, after showing
    protection against the Delta virus variant in a Phase 3 clinical trial in 16,876
    subjects in Iran. This vaccine is not available in Australia till today. Why?
•   Further to that, the deadline set for the Covid Inquiry submissions from the Office
    of Prime Minister and Cabinet is too short and suggests that this is clearly
    deliberate and appears intended to be a complete whitewash. Why?
