          Sydney Local Health District has been at the forefront of the state’s response to COVID-19, with staff caring for
          critically ill patients in intensive care and hospital wards, working at testing clinics, surveillance sites and Special
          Health Accommodation, and building systems, sites, and communication to support this important work.

          The COVID-19 pandemic has required the District to pivot its existing engagement strategies and work in new
          ways to not only maintain the connections with the community and networks, but also to work with the community
          groups and leaders and their networks to keep people safe from COVID-19.

          The District has begun to harness the strengths and incredible innovations from the COVID-19 response, to
          introduce new ideas into the organisation, change practice, and make plans for the future.
