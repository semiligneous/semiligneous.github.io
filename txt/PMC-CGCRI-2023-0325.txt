To the Covid-19 Response Inquiry Taskforce,

I am writing to let you know that an inquiry into Covid-19 is not good enough. I demand a
Royal Commission to the Covid-19 debacle.

Only a proper Royal Commission can investigate:
   •       Corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts
   •       Mask mandates
   •       Lock downs
   •       Vaccine mandates
   •   Official misinformation and censorship from the Government and its agencies
       including media
   •       Vaccine injuries and the poor treatment of victims
   •       The silencing and oppression of doctors by AHPRA and ATAGI



A Royal Commission is needed to uncover the cover-up.

Thank you for your consideration,
