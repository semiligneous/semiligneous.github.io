A number of welfare workers collected firsthand evidence and documentation regarding the harms
caused by mandatory and coerced vaccinations and lockdowns on the most vulnerable members of
Australia. This includes vulnerable cohorts such as DV, Drug and Alcohol addictions, disability, foster
care children, youth, and children and families.

Though your terms of reference state that you will not be focusing on State government policies,
there was a muddling of the lines between State and Federal. And Federal MP's who were
responsible for these vulnerable groups did not respond in a responsible manner when they were
made aware of the harms being caused. I therefore assert that this must be within your purview if
the inquiry is to be benefit in addressing harms caused and lessons learnt.

I also raise concerns with any Social Impact Bonds being generated on any issues that were further
intensified by government covidl9 measures. This includes mental health, children's learning,
homelessness. Please see two videos discussing why this model is of great concern.

Please find video outlining workers testimonials and newspaper articles documenting how
government Covidl9 measures effected the most vulnerable detrimentally.
