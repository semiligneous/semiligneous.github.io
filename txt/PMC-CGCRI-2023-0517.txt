I request a full Royal Commission for a proper investigation into:

      1.        Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts
      2.  Vaccine mandates
      3.  Vaccine injuries
      4.  Mask mandates and lockdowns
      5.  Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to
          block infection and transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and
          gaslighting of the injured
       6. The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable
          harm of the vaccine and their action along with ATAGI to silence the
          Medical Profession.

Personal hardship endured due to vaccine mandates:
I did not qualify for vaccine exemption given my existingchose to wait and
consequently lost my job which mandated vaccination. My doctor explained he was
powerless to make independent assessments and had to follow government mandates or
risk losing his license to practice.
My wife and two children were forced to accept the jabs in order to keep their jobs. They are
now suffering with noticeable decreased heart capacity.
My younger son had to be hospitalised following a stroke                We, the parents were
not allowed to visit him in hospital due to the mandates. We suffered immensely with
anguish, not being allowed to care for him during that time his cognition was compromised.
Health response measures:
The government ignored and banned alternative and early treatments for COVID sufferers,
i.e. Ivermectin and other which were proven effective treatments by world renowned doctors
and scientists. Instead, the government implemented the narrative set out by globalist
organisations such as W.H.O. and others whose funding model leaves it open to significant
potential conflicts of interests.

Australia must exit the W.H.O.
