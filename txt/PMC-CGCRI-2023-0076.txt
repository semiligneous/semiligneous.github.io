Submission to COVID-19 Response Inquiry

I am a|                         no prior health issues and since my first COVID infection
              Il have been disabled and unable to work,




Even though I was aware about Long COVID prior to my first infection, I was under the
impression that it was a continuation of cold symptoms, like a prolonged cough or some
lingering fatigue.

Instead I have struggled


I am severely disappointed in the lack of public health messaging about Long COVID. Had I
known about the potential long term effects I may have been able to reduce my exposure, or not
pushed myself to go back to work during my recovery which set me back considerably.

Having developed Long COVID Iâ€™ve since learned that it is not uncommon for people to develop
chronic, debilitating health conditions as a result of a viral infection. These health conditions
include ME/CFS, dysautonomia and many autoimmune conditions.

It is imperative that to prepare for future pandemics, as well as support those still affected by
COVID, that the Australian government invest in research to develop treatments for these
infection associated chronic conditions. Some repurposed and over the counter treatments
have alleviated my symptoms to a minor degree, but not enough to return
my previous life.

Improving ventilation and air filtration standards, especially in health care and public
settings would also allow me to more safely navigate indoor areas, as a COVID re-infection has
a high chance of further disabling someone disabled by Long COVID. This would also help to
prepare Australia for a future pandemic, and reduce the incidence of general illness in the
community.
