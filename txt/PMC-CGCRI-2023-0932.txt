I had                 approx 2 weeks after the first.
Since then I have never been so ill.                   ________________
My                      is back in full force. I've been^^^^^^^^^Mand have spent
months in hospital since. I have had heart failure and lung failure.
The fatigue is crippling to the point I cannot work after several attempts that lasted less than
a week most times because I crashed and burned due to                        No doctor will
advocate for me. In fact my cardiologist at the time said it wa^erfectl^afe to have the
second one.
That resulted in hospital due to vasso spasms
My ambulance bill is still in the thousands.
I HAD to have it otherwise all services that my Mum needed to continue live in her own
home would cease because I was mums full time carer for 7 years.
My goal was to keep her home as per her wishes.
As it was after the^^^^^H I had to reluctantly place her in a nursing home. I brought her
out after 6 months due to ongoing neglect. My mum suffered because of all this.
My quality of life is nothing like it was. I was a very healthy and active early       who
worked out several times weekly.
I'm sure
