A controlled "covid inquiry" is totally inadequate and will be a waste of taxpayer dollars.

There should, instead, be a proper Royal Commission for a full investigation into:

- possible corruption in vaccine procurement and secret contracts;
- mask mandates;
- lock downs;
- vaccine mandates,
- official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
transmission,
- vaccine injuries;
- media censorship,
- silencing of doctors and nurses,
- the roles AHPRA and ATAGI played in censorship and oppression of doctors, and
- the poor treatment of victims.


Only a Royal Commission can deliver the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
Without the whole truth, nothing useful can be discovered or uncovered, and the same
mistakes would be repeated.

A "Covid Inquiry" can easily be manipulated and is only whitewashing lip-service - we need
a Royal Commission instead.
