We run a small family business and also lease a Commercial property at


In 2020 during Covid the tenet stopped paying rent without any indication to us and
then refused to pay rent for the next four months. We consulted with ^^^|govt
agency and was referred for mediation, which was a total waste of time as the tenet
refused to provide any financials or why he had an inability to pay rent. He was never
questioned on this by the mediator ^^^^^^^^J^Vehave requested a copy of the
file notes and the outcome of this mediation from
referred us to             and he said it was confidential. To date the tenet still owes
approximately            which is something that we can’t and shouldn’t have to carry.

We believe he received Government assistance during Covid and probably more than
a normal business as his business appears to be registered under multiple names.

We wrote                   then Attorney General who was very dismissive of our
situation. She stated to take legal action which is all very well if you have the
finances to do so.

He failed to pay March, April, May and June and during this time I believe he only
closed business at the end of March and was open again early May, less than
approximately 10 weeks.

Section 12(2)a of the CO VID-19 Disease Emergency (Commercial Leases) Act 2020
imports the need to establish your inability to pay rent to which he did not.
If Govt have legislation they need to adhere to it and not expect you to use the legal
system which is very expensive.
