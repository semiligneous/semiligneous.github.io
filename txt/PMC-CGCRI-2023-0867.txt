                   Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry
                        To the Members of the Independent Panel,




    I am a retired RN with 43 years of senior clinical experience in Emergency,
Rehabilitation and Assessment... I was terminated for disobeying the directive to get
 vaccinated for an experimental COVID vaccine...



  Being on the front line I was expected to sacrifice my own health for the sake of
                                         others!



                      Concerns Over Specific Pandemic Measures
 Mask and Vaccine Mandates: The implementation of mask and vaccine mandates had
 significant impacts on individual freedoms and social dynamics. There has never been
   evidence that masks are effective as explained by Dr Fauci in the early days of the
          pandemic...we now know that they can cause serious pneumonias.
Lockdowns and Curfews: The economic, social, and psychological impacts of lockdowns
    and curfews have been profound. An evaluation of these measures is essential to
  understand their long-term effects on Australian society and whether they were the
                               most appropriate response.
Communication Strategies: It is quite clear that there was an unwarranted use of fear in
    public health messaging. It’s important to analyse whether such communication
strategies were effective or whether they contributed to unnecessary panic and distress
                                    among the public.
               Concerns Over the Composition and Scope of the Inquiry
 Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have previously
expressed support for certain pandemic measures raises questions about the objectivity
 and impartiality of the Inquiry. Panel members who have expressed support for such
                          measures should recuse themselves.
  Exclusion of Unilateral State and Territory Government Decisions: One of the most
significant omissions in the Inquiry’s scope is the exclusion of actions taken unilaterally
by state and territory governments. These decisions, including state-imposed lockdowns
  and border controls, were pivotal to the nation’s pandemic response and should be
                                 included in the Inquiry.
                         The Need for a Comprehensive Review
While the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry are extensive, it is crucial that the above­
 mentioned areas are not overlooked. A truly comprehensive review should encompass
all aspects of the government’s response, including those currently outside the Inquiry’s
                                          scope.


                                       Conclusion

      This submission represents a collective call for a more inclusive and thorough
investigation into Australia’s COVID-19 response. It also urges for freedom and liberty
    to not ever be cast aside with fearmongering as it was by Australian governments
      during the pandemic. We urge the Inquiry to consider these points to ensure
 transparency, accountability, and the safeguarding of Australian values and liberties.
