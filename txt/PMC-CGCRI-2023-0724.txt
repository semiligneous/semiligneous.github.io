I strongly request a full Royal Commission for a proper investigation into:

    1.      Vaccine procurement and any secret (redacted or not publicly available) vaccine contracts.
    2.     Vaccine mandates.
    3.     Vaccine injuries.
    4.     Mask mandates and lockdowns.
    5. Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block infection
       and transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gaslighting of the injured.
    6. The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable harm of the vaccine
       and their action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical Profession.
    7. Who decided to do the opposite of the 2019 Australian Health Management Plan for
       Pandemic Influenza, which prophetically described why all of the actions the Government
       did take would not work and would cause hardship?
    8. Who cleared the second order effects of MRNA modified blood to be able to be used on nonÂ­
       infected (vaccinated) people?
    9. Why was a state of emergency still in effect months and months after the CV19 critical period
       and how are MRNA vaccines still able to be administered when the current threat of
       infection is so miniscule?

The handling of the covid disaster, was literally that at an administrative level. A disaster. Not due to
the lives lost, but the complete shut down of Victoria for longer than any other state on earth! The
financial impacts on workers, the psychological impacts of children not being able to attend schools
or adults able to attend funerals. It was a complete mess from the PM down to the lowest of lowly
unelected bureaucrat making another disastrous claim after another.

There needs to be a publicly available, live streamed royal commission into this whole debacle.

Other nations with fortitude are doing so and have since openly stated their findings and failures.
Australia needs to do it too!
