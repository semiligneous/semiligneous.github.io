Submission to support enquiry into handling of the COVID 19 crisis in Australia.

I am an education officer in special education working across 56 schools in Newcastle. I have worked
in the field of special education for 35 years and as a teacher for 46 years. I have a Masters Degree in
Special Education.

During the pandemic we were told that children were not at high risk of serious illness from the
COVID virus but were potential spreaders and possible "granny killers". From the data produced from
several sources including the TGA data, we know that healthy children were not at risk of serious
health injury from COVID and we also know, and knew in 2021 from esteemed doctors and scientists,
that A-symptomatic transmission was baloney.

Since the return of students to school in November 2021, after extended periods of lockdown, the
impact on student's well-being, mental health, arrested social development and mental health has
been immeasurable. The effects on student learning, especially those thousands of students starting
school in 2021 and 2022, and young students in the early years of their schooling, is still being dealt
with in 2023.

I call for and support an enquiry into the handling of the COVID pandemic in Australia so that
government and officials will operate, in future, from a place of evidence, truth and integrity. There
are hundreds of thousands of children and young people who have had their mental health and
education impacted severely. This negative impact will shape society to some extent for generations.

Thank you for accepting this submission.
