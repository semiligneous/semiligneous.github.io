To the member of the Independent Panel


There is no doubt that we need a COVID Inquiry into all aspects of Australia’s response to
the COVID 19 pandemic, which should include -


Why we started with a nCoV-19 ‘new’ virus and why it changed to SARS-CoV-2, which
connects it back to 2002 outbreak of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China?
1.   WHO - health topics - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)



Why the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January
2020, with absolutely no evidence of a threatening pandemic (according to the numbers they
had at the time).
2.   WHO Report - 5th January 2020. Pneumonia of unknown cause - China. 44 cases of pneumonia - 11 seriously and 33 in stable condition.




Why the WHO adopted the RT-PCR test in January 23rd 2020 as a means to detect SARS-
CoV-2 when it’s inventor - Kary B Mullis stated emphatically in 1986 that ‘no infection or
illness can be accurately diagnosed with the RT-PCR test. It DOES NOT tell you that you are
sick!
And 1 year later the CDC - Centre for Disease control decide to withdraw the PCR test as a
valid method for detecting and identifying SARS-CoV-2 in the US? (WHO HAVING
ALREADY COFIRMED THAT THE TEST IS FLAWED.)
3.   Dr Christian Drosten and colleges - Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real time RT-PCR.

Daily Mail UK - Mar 12, 2022 - reluctantly acknowledges PCR test is flawed.
I remember hearing a short announcement on ABC News in Australia.
Nothing done about it!
To this day people in Australia are still using this test as a reliable method to see if they have
COVID!
Unbelievable.


The contentious issue of the RT-PCR test needs examining also.
In January 2020 WHO recommended these tests e conducted at 35 or higher cycle
amplification threshold.                            these scientists say -1



They go on to say-




This means these numbers were used to measure the progression of the so-called ‘pandemic’.
We must question if the pushing up of these numbers was used to sustain the fear campaign
so as to justify the ongoing draconian lockdown policies and implement a ‘need’ for a Covid
jab.
The question also needs to be asked. WHO confirmed in January 2020 that it ‘did not posses
from an infected patient’ an isolate of 2019nCoV of a purified sample. Meaning - they were
unable to confirm the identity of the novel corona virus - is this why the ‘n’ for novel - or
‘new’ was changed to SARS-CoV-2? 4. International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses - Feb 11 2020.
SARS-CoV-1 had already been confirmed by WHO and had been peer reviewed -as well as a
Patent filed to the US Department of Health and Human Services - Patent #: US 7,220,852
Bl Date of Patent: May 22, 2007 - pertaining to the 2003 SARS-CoV.
Berlin Virology Institute Study recommended to WHO — 5. Eurosurveillance - Research detection of
2019- VOL 25, Issue 3: 23 January, 2020 - ‘a similar 2003 SARS-CoV virus should be used as a ‘proxy’ or point of reference of
the novel 2019 Coronavirus.

So, all COVID 19 confirmed cases or infections resulting from 2019 novel coronavirus
would be validated by the close genetic relatedness to the2003 SARS-CoV-1.
Quandary.
How can it - if it has not been identified - ie without an isolate?
This all needs to be sorted as country’s around the world have had their lives thrown into
chaos and upheaval, based on this flawed and invalid RT-PCR case positives.
It does make me question if there ever was a ‘new coronavirus’ - or, for that matter - a
pandemic.
