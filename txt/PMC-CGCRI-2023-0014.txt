Submission to COVID Inquiry
Stephen Duckett
Honorary Enterprise Professor, School of Population and Global Health

University of Melbourne


1.   The ongoing COVID pandemic has elevated infectious diseases into one of Australia's leading
      contemporary causes of death.
2.   The debates and decisions of the first years of the pandemic have shaped the subsequent public
      health response. Although much was done well in those early years, much was not.
3.   I have recounted the history of those years in a number of papers, the most complete being
      Duckett (2022b), attached to this submission.
4.   The review has an opportunity to look forward into what might be done differently in the future.
5.   In my view critical to that is trying to get all the players on the same page. Unfortunately, that
      was not the case in 2020 and 2021 as I have demonstrated.
6.   So, how might that be done? At the least there should be transparency: the advice of public
      officials should be available for scrutiny and debate contemporaneously as I have argued in
      Duckett (2022a), also attached to the submission.
