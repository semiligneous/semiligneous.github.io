Office of the Prime Minister Parliament House Canberra, ACT 2600 Australia
Dear Prime Minister Anthony Albanese,
I am writing to you with deep concern regarding the management of the COVID-19
pandemic, specifically focusing on issues related to vaccine procurement, public
health measures, and information dissemination. Given the gravity of the situation
and the potential impact on public health and trust, I strongly urge you to consider
establishing a Royal Commission to thoroughly investigate the following matters:


Corrupt Vaccine Procurement and Secret Contracts:
Request a comprehensive investigation into vaccine procurement processes,
ensuring transparency and accountability. Examine any potential irregularities,
conflicts of interest, or secret contracts that may have influenced the decisionÂ­
making process.


Mask Mandates and Lockdowns:
Assess the efficacy and necessity of mask mandates and lockdown measures,
considering their impact on public health, the economy, and individual liberties.
Investigate whether these measures were based on sound scientific evidence and
expert advice.


Vaccine Mandates:
Examine the rationale behind vaccine mandates, exploring their legality, ethical
implications, and potential consequences. Assess the necessity of such mandates and
whether alternative measures could achieve the same public health goals.


Official Misinformation and Lies in the Media:
Investigate instances of misinformation and deceptive practices in the media
concerning the effectiveness of vaccines in blocking transmission. Ensure that
accurate and evidence-based information is disseminated to the public.


Vaccine Injuries:
Scrutinize reported vaccine injuries and adverse effects, determining the extent of
their occurrence and the adequacy of support for affected individuals. Assess
whether there are systemic issues in reporting and addressing vaccine-related
complications.


Media Censorship and Silencing of Doctors:
 Investigate claims of media censorship and the suppression of dissenting voices,
particularly from healthcare professionals. Ensure that open dialogue and diverse
perspectives are encouraged to promote a robust and informed public discourse.


Role of AHPRA and ATAGI in Censorship and Oppression of Doctors:
Examine the roles of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA)
and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) in the
censorship and suppression of doctors expressing alternative viewpoints. Ensure that
regulatory bodies support professional autonomy and freedom of expression.


Treatment of Victims:
Investigate the treatment of individuals who have experienced adverse effects from
vaccination and assess the government's response to their needs. Additionally,
review the circumstances surrounding the stonewalling of results from the Adelaide
vaccine trial, ensuring transparency in the evaluation of its efficacy.


Stonewalling of Adelaide Vaccine Results:
Vaxine PTY LTD has a vaccine that has proven to be safe and actually work with
results showing limiting of transmission, Vaxine PTY LTD was stonewalled and^^H
^(banned from talking about their vaccine, this is a complete disgrace and disregard
of the safety of the people, no vaccine especially from a company with a long history
of success as Vaxine.


I believe that a Royal Commission would provide the necessary framework to
impartially examine these issues, restore public confidence, and ensure that
Australia's response to the pandemic is grounded in transparency, accountability,
and the best interests of the citizens.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will give due
consideration to the establishment of a Royal Commission to address these concerns
and promote public trust in the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
