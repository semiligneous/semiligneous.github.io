Pandemic Submission
15/12/2023




   1) I would like to ask why on earth the existing pandemic plans were completely ignored? If
      they were not fit for purpose, why were they done in the first place?


   2) I would like to ask if any of the people involved in this enquiry can possibly imagine
      what it is like to be forced not to work, be ostracised from friends, family, gyms, cafe,
      and community life I general?
   3)    Why were our state borders allowed to be closed?

   I am deeply shocked, saddened, and ashamed of what was allowed to take place in Australia.
   This is, or was supposed to be a free country.


   As an aside, my partners]                     |, who is a              now has pericarditis
   (symptoms began the day after her first and only vaccination). She is among the numerous
   people that I know personally who have had their lives irrevocably changed by the shocking
   decisions and brutal actions of our supposed leaders

   How was, or is, any of this ok?
   Where and how are the people in charge ever to be held accountable?


   Thank you,

Richard McNay
