Dear Sir/Madam,

I trust this submission finds you well. I am an Australia citizen who is a passionate advocate for natural health
and critical thinking, I am compelled to address several critical concerns regarding the Commonwealth
Government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The limited timeframe for submissions, especially during the festive season, raises questions about the
transparency and accessibility of the inquiry. It is my hope that my scepticism is proven wrong, and the
issues raised in this, and other submissions are rigorously addressed.

The 'Covid Era' has witnessed unprecedented government powers, life-altering decisions based on limited
information, and coercion against those questioning measures. Lessons from this era are crucial for
upholding Australia's identity as a free country respecting human rights.

Governance issues, such as the National Cabinet operating in secrecy, border closures impacting citizens'
return, and the concentration of power in the Prime Minister's hands, demand scrutiny and accountability.

The dismissal of proven treatments like Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, coupled with the questionable
emergency approval of MRNA therapies, raises concerns about regulatory independence and the
government's duty of care.

The Federal Government's silence on border closures' inhumane consequences and the lack of
transparency surrounding the National Cabinet further erode public trust. Mandating medical procedures
violates human rights, demanding a reconsideration of such actions.

To further illuminate the broader context, it's imperative to acknowledge that to date, the Federal
Government has spent at least AUD 18 billion on Covid vaccines and treatments. This equates to around
AUD 1200 transferred from the pocket of every tax-paying Australian, assuming 15 million taxpayers based
on recent stats, straight into Big Pharma's coffers.

The treatment of the vaccine-injured remains a cause for concern, with many unable to secure basic
compensation from the narrow Federal scheme. Regulatory failures by the Therapeutic Goods
Administration, including the suppression of reported child deaths to manipulate public opinion on the
vaccination program, underscore the need for a robust inquiry.

Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison's discreet appointment to five different ministries and the attempt to
keep the minutes of national cabinet meetings top secret further contribute to the shadows cast on the
transparency and accountability of our government.

Now, let's navigate through the intriguing world of vaccine procurement and distribution. Australia, with a
population just over 26 million, acquired a staggering 255 million vaccine doses - enough for every
Australian to be jabbed not once, not twice, but a generous ten times. A mathematical marvel that
showcases not only extravagant spending but also a level of calculation expertise that could, quite
humorously, be described as truly impressive.

Over half of these doses found themselves in the proverbial bin, a testament to the government's prodigious
spending and perhaps a subtle nod to their exceptional mathematical prowess. The question lingering in
the air is, who truly benefits from these decisions? It appears not the Australian citizens, diligently contributing
through their taxes.

In conclusion, the inquiry must address these multifaceted issues comprehensively, ensuring accountability,
transparency, and a steadfast commitment to the well-being and rights of the Australian people.

The Australian people are fully aware of what is happening. Rest assured they will be watching vey closely, I
certainly hope this inquiry is up to the task!

Very concern Australian resident.
