The Enquiry is a farce due to
   1.    Short notice for submissions
  2. Close-off on the lead-up to the holiday season will result in fewer
     responses.
  3. Online only discriminates against people who do not have computer
     access.
  4.     Three page limit does not allow reasonable submissions and evidence
  5.     Doubtful impartiality of inquiry members. (See Below)
  6.     Not widely promoted.
  7. Limited scope (Does not allow the criminal behaviour to be
     discussed)
  8.     Scope does not include state governments.
  9.     Evidence of vaccine injury withheld by the Government (See Below)
   io.   Harm caused by immoral mask and vaccine mandates
   11.   Cover up of suicide rates due to lock downs and over restrictions.
   12. Destruction of small business in favour of large multinational
      companies.
   13. Treasonous behaviour of state and federal governments who are
      acting for foreigners
Due to space restrictions, only some topics will be addressed and then only
partially.

5. Doubtful Impartiality
Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have
previously expressed support for certain pandemic measures raises
questions about the objectivity and impartiality of the Inquiry. Panel
members who have expressed support for such measures should recuse
themselves.

Professor Catherine Bennett, Deakin University chair of epidemiology,
says...
“...We have to ensure people have all their recommended boosters because
the booster gives you a bit more cross-immunity and protection from
Omicron. It reduces the risk of serious illness quite dramatically. The
winter booster dose brings down the serious infection risk by another two-
thirds in people at the highest risk who might now also have less
protection from their first booster...”

14 Evidence of vaccine njury withheld by the Government
The Australian government has not released the data that shows the true
extent of vaccine injuries and death and nor does not provide adequate
protection for whistle blowers like the New Zealand Whistle blower I
Young.


While Australia has not released the data, estimations can be made based
on the NZ data leak. As documented by screenshots made from the
censored video below.

The data shows that the deaths from the vaccine depend on the site
administering the vaccine (Up to 31% who received the vaccine died soon
after) and also based on the batch number of the vaccine (The worst batch
recorded had a kill rate of 21 %)


Conclusions
  • The vaccination program has been carried out for the profits of large
    corperations^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^M.
  • The Australian Governments, both federal and state have been
    involved
  • Doctors have been forced to go along with the cover up or risk de­
    registration
  • The Australian Government has been acting in treason to foreign
    powers and against the interests of the people.
  • The crimes committed by the Australian Government are of the
    highest order.
  •     The Australian Government can not be permitted to continue with

  • International Treaties such as the W.H.O pandemic treaty should not
    be ratified.
  • Members of state and federal government need to be investigated for
    crimes.
