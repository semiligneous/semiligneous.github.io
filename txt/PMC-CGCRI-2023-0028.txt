To whom it may concern,

I                                                               the Victorian/NSW border.

When we went through covid, the most difficult thing to cope with, apart from the isolation, was not
being able to cross the state border without a permit.

It seemed like no one understood that we have to access different services on both sides of the border
and that numerous people work every day on opposite sides of the border to where they live.

This is something that I thought was badly managed from the start and if it is to happen again needs
much better strategic planning.

While I was banned from crossing the border^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H^Hwas allowed to cross
because of his work.

I seriously think we could learn a lot from the nation of Japan as to how we handle disease that is easily
spread.

I would happily comply with wearing masks as a means of prevention of spread.

Also I would like the time frame of infection and ability to spread the disease more accurately described.

This would help with any quarantine obligations, it has never been clear and still is not clear to me.

If we only had the one health service on one side of the border here it would not cope.

Both Wodonga city and Albury city handle large regional catchments of people accessing health care
since the smaller fully functional hospitals around the regions were defunded by government.

At the rate of regional growth in this area we will soon need a third hospital after the mess that
Albury/Wodonga health has become.

Our State governments need to be able to work together in times of National adversity.

Thank you.
