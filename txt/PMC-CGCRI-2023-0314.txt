I, Shae Karringten, demand that a Royal Commission for a full investigation of the government's
responses to COVID-19 be created.

The details of the corrupt vaccine acquisitions that have been done need to come to light, as well as
the details of the secret contracts with vaccine manufacturers which have been to the detriment of
the Australian public, which the government has refused to make public although it is the Australian
taxpayer who has been footing the bill. If the taxpayer is paying for it, we have a right to know every
detail and no manufacturer of any industry should ever be allowed indemnity. If the product is proven
not work or to cause injury, of which now there is a multitude of evidence, then the manufacturer is
liable.

It is now known that the Australian government was a full and willing participated in misinformation
about vaccines blocking transmission, continuing to parrot the narrative of what the pharmaceutical
companies wished, wilfully ignoring the data that was coming in on the increase in the chronic illnesses
and the injuries and deaths that resulted from a refusal to listen to doctors and nurses who were
reporting what they saw in hospitals and clinics and scientists who were independently analysing the
incoming data.

The government also allowed AHPRA's and ATAGI's censoring and revoking of licences and other
penalties for doctors and other professionals, while these professionals were only trying to do what
was best for their patients. Then there's the illegal vaccine mandates and lockdowns where the
government decided to invert the general and accepted practice of only confining the sick and thus
resulting in skyrocketing of both physical and mental illnesses in the entire population, and giving
people a choice of only being able to earn a living if they took an experimental drug of which the true
ingredients were not known and have since been shown to vary in batches, and of which the potential
hazards and long-term side effects were also not known.

The government is there to SERVE the people, not act as an overlord. There is a long list of conflicts
of interest regarding major politicians and health ministers (I have attached two links below), All
aspects of the government's actions MUST be analysed and ALL details must be made public, and
appropriate penalties for ALL the politicians that participated (ie. repayment of each politician's gross
salary for the past 4 years would be appropriate), whether they are currently serving in a political
capacity of not, MUST be applied.

Regards,

Shae Karringten
