RE: Call for Covid Inquiry and Royal Commission

Dear Prime Minister Albanese,

As an Australian, I demand the following inquiries and a Royal Commission into the treacherous Covid
behaviours conducted by the Australian government and bodies.

    1.        I DEMAND a royal commission for a FULL investigation!
         2.          EXPOSE corrupt vaccine acquisitions and SECRET contracts with Vaccine manufacturers!
         3.          Illegal vaccine mandates!
         4.          Official misinformation about vaccines blocking transmission!
         5.          Vaccine injuries!
         6.          Silencing of doctors and experts!
         7.          AHPRA and ATAGI's censorship of doctors!
         8.          ATG banning of life saving medicines like Ivermectin and HCQ.


         Regards,
