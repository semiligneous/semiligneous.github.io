I would like to provide a submission but have trouble typing so cannot provide extensive details.
But I wish to be heard.

My entire life was thrown into chaos when my employer mandated the vaccine.
I decided I did not consent to being part of a medical experiment, using a vaccine which has since

The average age of death from COVID is higher than the average age of death.
What more do you need to know to see how criminal this is.
