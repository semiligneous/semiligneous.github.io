When covid struck I was                                                             I had been with one
client for^^^^^ears seeing her ^Hdays every week forjhrs at a time, sometimes longer, I had been
working with another client for nearly               days a week forjirs a day., then the mandate was
introduced, as I did not feel comfortable having the injection it meant I was stood down from my
position, with zero compensation either financially or emotionally. Both of these clients passed away not
long after, as you can imagine spending this amount of time with a person is quite often more time than
those spend with their own families, to say I was heart broken would be an extreme understatement! I
was emotionally and financially ruined. Just before covid hit my daughter purchased her first home,
mandate came along and she felt she had to choose between keeping her house by having the injection
or quit and lose everything. The covid mandates and fear mongering from the government was direct
harassment, intimidation, bullying, threatening and discrimination! I and also just signed up with an
online platform as a         this would be my own business, it cost me money to get into that I then
ultimately lost due to making a choice of not wanting the injection. I feel during this time money was
given to the wrong people, giving people on centrelink, especially the ones that have never worked is
what sent us into the financial crisis that is. Workers and business owners were not looked after, with
them also being made feel like they had no choice but to enforce their own mandates. The government
made a huge mistake and now we the people are paying for it. At the end of the day it doesn't really
matter what people say, or how many people have lost their lives due to the government's decisions.,
they don't care, they have their own hidden agendas and we the people will never know!
