To the independent members of the panel,


I write to you today to urge you to look deeper into the government overreach that occurred during
the Covid mandates, lockdowns, lockouts, masking, curfews etc.


Mandates: no one in a free country should have to choose between putting an experimental vaccine
in their body and their workplace/job/livelihood. In a free country people should be free to choose.
And the false promise of stopping transmission and stopping you from getting sick were both lies­
and our government knew it.


Lockdowns (and lockouts for the unvaccinated) did NOT flatten the curve as promised and it did
nothing positive for people mental health nor for our economy. Many businesses went broke.
Suicided increased as did domestic violence. And some states like Victoria abused their people
keeping them locked in and locked up for months and months- for no positive outcome.


Masking was a joke and has since been proven to actually be worse for people's health breathing in
their own bacteria and stale carbon dioxide. Nowhere in history have people who are healthy and
well been subject to such measures.


Curfews were the same. Viruses do not have the ability to tell day from night, they are transmissible
at all hours. This was just overreach and control on the people for no good reason.

We the people deserve a real Covid enquiry that will look at all aspects of how the ‘pandemic’ was
handled. We are opposed to having our freedoms trampled on by government overreach. We want
the truth, we want our freedom back and we want a royal commission into the handling of Covid.
And those who were sacked for not getting the jab also deserve their jobs back with an apology and
back pay. Our medical sector is screaming out for staff, and our non-jabbed nurses, paramedics,
doctors are still being sidelined and punished. Get them back to helping people.

Regards Faithfully
