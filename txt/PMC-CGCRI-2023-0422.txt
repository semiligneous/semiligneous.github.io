 KB: Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry submission




From Keith Bannerman: Commonwealth
Government COVID-19 Response Inqu ry
submission.
Dear Inquiry - Please can you have the common decency to
run a proper, thorough inquiry, not the usual Governmental
‘stitch-up’, white-washing, “nothing to see here” sort of
exercise I have come to expect. I represent only myself
and maybe about 20 million other Australians.

My Submission Focus Points/requests are listed below:



1. I request a royal commission for a FULL investigation !

2. Please EXPOSE corrupt vaccine acquisitions and
SECRET contracts with Vaccine manufacturers !

3. Please EXPOSE Illegal vaccine mandates !

4. Please EXPOSE Official misinformation about vaccines
blocking transmission !

5. Please EXPOSE Vaccine injuries !

6. Please EXPOSE the Silencing of doctors and experts !

7. Please EXPOSE AHPRA and ATAGI's censorship of
doctors!


Kind regards - Keith Bannerman,
