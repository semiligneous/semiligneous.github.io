I would like to take the opportunity to state my opposition to all proposed changes to WHO
and our rights to Personal discretion in who shares and what is shared about a patient. Our
right to say whether a Health /Id digital identity is passed. I disagree with this breach of
fairness that no referendums are being sought on very important matters that affect
individuals and Australia as a whole country. We should have the right to say “No!” No to
being jabbed by anything as a personal right of law. We should have a right to make the
choice to move freely in community without Government regulating when a member of the
community is allowed to leave their houses and without the threat of arrest. We should have
the right to Free Speech unless it incites hatred or violence. We should not be censored and
freedom of the press and all information should be a given. We the people have our rights.
We elect our government. We decide whaf s in Australia’s best interests and retaining
personal power is first.

Thank you A Yours Faithfully
Kathlynne Burbidge.
