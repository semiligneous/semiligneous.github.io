I write as a very concerned Australian citizen.

I request that there be a full, open, honest and wide-ranging inquiry via a royal
commission, into the impact of the australian and state government responses
to the cv pandemic. This inquiry must be undertaken by independent experts
from a wide field of experience.

This is urgently needed.

This needs to include:

   •      the indemnity given to pharmaceutical companies re the cv vaccine
   •   the fact that each v did not undergo standard long-term clinical trial data
       outcomes
   •   the true number of deaths as a result of the cv (tga only publicly admits
       to 14 deaths, but this is not the true number in their own database)
   •      the true number of v injuries
   •      statistics of different v injuries
   •      v mandates
   •   the silencing of doctors and the fear of punishment and reprisal through
       censorship and oppression by both aphra and atagi
   •      media censorship
   •      blackmailing of the population through forced v to keep their jobs
   •      the consequences of lockdowns
   •      the closing of state borders
   •      the secret national cabinet meetings
   •      the impact on mental health across society
   •   the ongoing impact of forced school closures on student's mental health
       and the documented deteriorating academic performance
   •   the constant fear messaging and pressure by all government
       departments throughout the pandemic

Why my concern?

   •       I personally know people who have been permanently injured by the v
   •   I personally know of previously healthy people who have serious health
       issues that appeared suddenly after the v was given
   •   This includes serious ongoing heart issues; lung issues; breast cancer;
       and a debilitating neurological disorder
   •   I personally know of people whose employment was terminated by their
       employer
   •   I personally know of people who were not reinstated once the mandates
       were lifted, such was the stigma associated with not being v
   •       I hear many stories similar to this in talking to family and friends
I see the consequences of all the above

   •   the devastation of the economy due to shut down of businesses and
       resulting permanent closure of many businesses
   •   the subsequent loss of jobs, productivity and businesses, still happening
       post pandemic today
   •   the loss of jobs leading to loss of income, loss of businesses and loss of
       homes
   •      the resultant increased homeless-ness across australia

We now have

   •   a crisis in our health systems through lack of sufficient staff because the
       mandates forced many out
   •       a crisis in our policing numbers for the same reason
   •       a crisis in the education system for the same reason
   •   a crisis seen in increased ambulance ramping at our hospitals as a
       result of reduced staff
   •   the above crises as a consequence of termination of employment and
       failure to reinstate public servants
   •       a crisis of increased homeless-ness
   •       a coming crisis in the downturn in our economy

A full, open, honest and wide-ranging inquiry is required
by independent experts to address these very serious issues of mis­
management by the federal and state governments, during the pandemic.

This is urgently needed.

Failure to do so can only indicate there is something the population is not privy
to know...?
