This is my story, story of my family and how the Australian Federal and state governments failed us
during Covid 19 Pandemic.

I was stuck in India along with my family                                         during the height of the Delta
Variant wave in India back in April 2021. I had to fly out to India in Feb 21 after taking clearance from
DFAT as my                    was                                      and his last wish was to see his
   â– /Ve felt it is just right that we should try to fulfil at least his last wish as well as did not want to
deprive our^^the chance to say bye to his                     We knew while going out that it is likely that we
have to stay for 3 months. To our sheer bad luck, Delta variant stick in India in April 2021. Our whole
family was stuck by it, I was admitted to hospital and was in my death bed
       |and got out only after 10 days. Our                                        and I
and my        was also down with Covid. I lost my            to Covid after she fought it valiantly for 25 days.
There was no flight in sight, and Mr. Morrisson took the executive in humanitarian decision aided by the
so called 'National Cabinet' (who as was later pointed out had no legal validation just a bunch of
        | joined together in a special enclave - https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/national-
cabinet-thrown-open-to-scrutiny-in-ruling-it-is-not-a-cabinet-20210805-p58ga3.html)that he will like to
stop all flights from India. After Australian Citizens dies in India he resumed the flight back in 15th May
2021 under immense pressure (why should not he becalled as a                   and national cabinet
accomplice in ^^^Hl wonder). The citizens will have to fly back and then will have to undergo
quarantine (which per law is ok because it falls under bio security and under health regulation it is
perfectly legal). We were given a flight to fly back on 3rd June to Adelaide (and that at an exorbitant
price) and then had to quarantine at a hotel there for 14 days. I requested that I be allowed some fresh
air (at leas^^Dossibl^^^aalcony can be provided) as I was suffering from^^^^^^^^^^^^Mand
was                              but I was denied the same. This caused further damage to my




On top of that I was issued with a bill for the hotel quanrantine. Now as per section 108 of the
Biosecurity act the Commonwealth is liable to pay for reasonable expenses incurred by an
individual in complying with a biosecurity measure included in a human biosecurity
control order. Although this was a biosecurity control order issues by Australian Federal
government and various state and territory governments but still the bill was issued to
us not to the commonwealth. It has been argued that the bill has been issued under
state legislation, however in case of parallel application of law it is the Federal Law that
prevails in the commonwealth, so section 108 will prevail over any state legislation. This
is another example of blatant illegality under which the scheme has been operated.


If I was given the power I would have bought the charge of bullying, mental and financial
harassment anc            against Government of South Australia and the Federal
Government of Australia. We sadly have a bunch of             running the parliaments,
we are ashamed that we elect these bunch of         every 4 years as we have no better
alternatives.              they are !!!
At least the quanratine bills that has been issued should immediately
be revoked as that is clearly illegal as per bio security law.
