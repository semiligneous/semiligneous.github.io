As a person with a disability living in Victoria, the Covid response was crippling to me. The
abrupt changes in lifestyle decreased my ability to function mostly independently within society.

The governance of national cabinet was disappointing, not reining in the over use of power by
power mad premiers like Andrews who turned on with people, even shooting at them with
rubber bullets.

As someone who has a mask exemption I have even recently been turned away from a hospital
(late September 2023 - ^^^^^^^^^hospital). I was denied access to Centrelink because
of my exemption and inability to wear a mask          Centrelink). I was harassed by members of
the public. I still suffer trauma response from masks and struggle to access health care to this
date.

As a casual employee I lost shifts very early as our industry was heavily affected (early March
2020). I was without income for 7 weeks before receiving payments from Centrelink. Combined
with my disability I now struggle to work, as I can no longer go to unfamiliar places without high
levels of anxiety and fear, negatively impacting both my work and social life.

I was not scared of the virus. But I was terrified of government responses.
