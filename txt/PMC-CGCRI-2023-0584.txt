To the Honorable Members of the Australian Federal Government,

Subject: Request for a Royal Commission into COVID-19 Response Measures

I hereby submit a formal request for the establishment of a Royal Commission
to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation into the Australian
government's procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, the establishment and
enforcement of mask mandates, the imposition of lockdowns, and the
promulgation of vaccine mandates. This request also extends to the
examination of misinformation disseminated through media outlets
concerning the efficacy of vaccines in preventing transmission, the
documentation and handling of vaccine-related injuries, and media censorship
and suppression of medical professionals.

Moreover, the inquiry should encompass the activities and policies of the
Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and the Australian
Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) in their oversight and
censorship roles. There is a significant concern that these actions have resulted
in the silencing of healthcare professionals and a perceived oppression of
divergent scientific opinions, which merits thorough investigation.

The lack of clear scientific justification for lockdowns has had a profound
personal impact on many, including myself, which resulted in prolonged
separation from my elderly parents. Additionally, the enforcement of mask
mandates led to distressing experiences of discrimination in public settings,
despite possessing a legitimate medical exemption from wearing face
coverings.

The necessity for a Royal Commission is underscored by the belief that only
such a body can provide the comprehensive and impartial examination
required to address the concerns of the Australian public. There is a perception
among many citizens that reluctance to initiate such an inquiry may stem from
a desire within the government to obscure the full details of its actions during
the pandemic.

Considering these serious concerns, it is imperative that the government take
decisive action to establish a Royal Commission, thereby demonstrating its
commitment to transparency, accountability, and the principles of democratic
governance. I, along with others who share these concerns, am eager for the
assurance that all aspects of the government's response to the COVID-19
pandemic will be subject to the highest degree of scrutiny.

I trust that the government will acknowledge the gravity of these issues and
will act promptly to address the public's call for a full and transparent inquiry.

Respectfully submitted,

Ms.
Bottom of Form
