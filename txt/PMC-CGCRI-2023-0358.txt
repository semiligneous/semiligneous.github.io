Royal Commission for proper investigation into Covid absolutely necessary so that its
devastating results never happen again.
I am writing this very briefly due to lack of time - currently doing overtime at work.

The public were told the vaccine would stop the spread of covid before that information was
even known - all over the mainstream media. This was soon to be false and proven wrong.
This caused the most insulting and intimidating consequences to our family of four.
Our son could not play basketball due to our family decision making - discussed over our dinner
each night.
This was a huge part of his teenage social life,confidence,health,fitness and mental health.
He was also terminated from a first year plumbing apprenticeship. Devastating to his start as a
well adjusted successful adult.
Our daughter won a dance trophy,however we could not be in the audience - very upsetting for
all of us.
We could not attend my eldest sister funeral - a battle with breast cancer.
I thought I was going to lose my job of 18yrs that I loved - so I started a small business.
My husband was not allowed to be at his workplace - unable to provide for his family.
I was accused at work that ‘I would make people drop dead in the streets’.
Our own brothers and sisters told us we didn’t deserve to go to hospital if we got sick.
Devastating!
Many more people suffered much worse consequences - needlessly.
My husband got covid and recovered after 5 days - with no vaccine.
I have not even caught covid - with no vaccine.
Many people we know got covid, recovered, with no vaccine, no hospitalization.
It took an FOI to publicly show data that proves much false information given about covid.
We must remain making sovereign decisions about pandemic responses - not dictated to by
foreign unelected bureaucrats in the future.
