 My^^^^Hand I are not vaccinated. We never caught Covid-19 although we were
always around people who were diagnosed. All my other family were vaccinated. Some
twice, some 3 or 4 or even 5 times. All have also had Covid numerous times. They have
 ALL had ongoing health issues, from                               and      problems. My
^^^^Jand I were caught up in                             cluster in South Australia. It was
very difficult for us, as I am a single parent on a low income and we had to quarantine
for 2 weeks. We have no family nearby. I couldn't order groceries online as all home
deliveries were fully booked. Further, even if deliveries were available, the cost for
delivery was prohibitive on my budget. I did have a                    or
 representative contact me. I was upset about this because they were given my personal
details by SA Health without my permission. Many privacy issues were breached during
this time. When I asked what they could do to support me financially and with food
during this time, they told me they couldn't do anything. They were just calling to check
we were ok! This really frustrated me. We were also ostracised from many social
gatherings like the                 The Zoo, Restaurants and other venues. We were
never unwell. The whole period was and financially and mentally challenging. Especially
for my         who loves School. It was a very dark period for our family. This should
never happen again!
