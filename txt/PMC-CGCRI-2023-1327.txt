My submission pertains to the following

    •   Governance including the role of the Commonwealth Government,
        responsibilities of state and territory governments, national governance
        mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination Mechanism
        and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory
        bodies supporting responses to COVID-19.



    •   Key health response measures (for example across COVID-19 vaccinations
        and treatments, key medical supplies such as personal protective equipment,
        quarantine facilities, and public health messaging).




I would like to know why the Covid - 19 vaccine(s) were approved and continues to be used despite
significant evidence that they are dangerous and have done and continue to injure and kill people in
Australia.

I'd also like to know who and when Australian Politicians both Federal and State and Health Officials
both Federal and State will be charged and prosecuted for approving, at times mandating and
continuing to advocate for the use of Covid-19 vaccines despite significant evidence that they are
dangerous and have done, and continue to, injure and kill people in Australia.

I would like to know why the All Cause Mortality in Australia has increased in the last few years
following the roll out of the Covid - 19 Vaccines and yet, no Australian Federal or State Politician or
Federal or State Health official can explain the reason.

I have included as evidence to support my submission a document published by the Australian
Medical Professional Society called "Too Many Dead".
