To the Covid Inquiry Panel,
I have had insufficient time to prepare an extensive response to the panel which I
would like to be taken into consideration. There is plenty more that could be said.
There are so many very serious issues surrounding the whole covid period that really
need addressing, preferably via a Royal Commission.
First and foremost, I would like to share my experience of the last three years. I
work in a senior role and I have been isolated from my colleagues, working at home
throughout covid due to being unvaccinated. I have lived with the perpetual threat of
being fired at any moment for being unvaccinated for literally years. I would like the
Panel to consider what the effect of this threat would be on them individually.
The unvaccinated are never mentioned now. It’s like we don’t exist. The vast
majority of us have not had covid and are healthy. Yet, we suffer massive
discrimination and those who don’t know any better are still afraid of us. The NSW
government has stopped publishing statistics on the unvaccinated because we’re not
sick, hospitalised or dead - despite the fact that many unvaccinated tax-paying
people have been denied medical treatment and often in life threatening situations.
I wish to express my disgust at the media lies and fearmongering surrounding the
virus, the unvaccinated and everything to do with covid.
The people responsible for the crimes committed against the Australian people need
to be held accountable.
As a Financial Manager, I am disgusted at the vast amounts of tax payer money that
has been squandered on deceptive media adverts and coverage and the
government propaganda, fear mongering and manipulation of the public.
I trust that the Panel will take these matters seriously and hold people accountable.
