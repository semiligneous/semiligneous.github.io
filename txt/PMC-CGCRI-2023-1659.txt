RE: Submission to the Covid-19 Response Inquiry Taskforce

                                                   SUBMISSION

Introduction




As the representative of Freedom Media WA in Perth, Western Australia, I present this submission to the Commonwealth
Government's COVID-19 Response Inquiry.

Our independent platform emerged at the start of the pandemic in response to widespread concerns in Western Australia
about the mainstream media's compromised independence, revealing clear political and economic biases that undermined
objectivity.

Consequently, we positioned ourselves as the 'media of the people,' proud of our impactful community contributions,
shedding light on real stories and social injustices overlooked by legacy mainstream media.

Observations of the Main Impacts through the lens of Independent Media




1)        Mandatory Covid-19 Vaccinations

Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison, declared during a nationally broadcast press conference on August 9, 2021 -
(quote)

“We are not going to seek to impose a mandatory vaccination program by stealth”

and

“I wouldn't want it suggested that either the Federal Government or the state and territory governments are
seeking to impose a mandatory process on this vaccination program for Australians. We have been very clear
about that."

The above statements directly challenged the July 2021 National Cabinet decision, led by former Prime Minister Scott
Morrison, mandating COVID-19 vaccines for all residential aged care workers.

Following the swift implementation of the vaccination mandates for residential aged care workers in Western Australia,
we were flooded with calls and emails from community members detailing instances of being denied access to their loved
ones in aged care unless they got vaccinated.

in my submission, this amounts to a "mandatory vaccination program by stealth," contradicting assurances from former
Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Our records document nine instances where personal accounts were reported and
subsequently verified.

I want to emphasize key issues with the implied mandatory vaccination of families in residential aged care:

      •   We confirmed numerous reports of immediate family members being refused the chance to bid farewell to those
          with DNR orders unless they complied with a minimum of two COVID-19 vaccinations, with three (3) instances
          of loved ones passing before the "minimum vaccination entry requirements"
     •       We confirmed numerous reports of immediate family members being denied opportunity to say last goodbyes
             to loved ones with 'Do Not Resuscitate' (DNR) orders in place.


     •       We confirmed numerous reports of family members being prevented in removing loved ones with end-of-life
             treatment plans in place, their passing being imminent, contingent on each family member having a minimum of
             two COVID-19 vaccinations.


     •           The Covid-19 Response Inquiry Panel need to understand, these inhumane requirements;
                 •                    occurred at a time when the availability of COVID-19 vaccines was limited,
                 •       Australian citizens with loved ones in aged care couldn't gain immediate access as there was a
                         ‘vaccination’ schedule restricted to approved age cohorts only,
                 •                    the required two dose requirement was only permitted over a three-month period.

We've recorded instances where immediate family members approached us, shedding light on their struggles. Legacy mainstream
media in Western Australia, showed no interest in covering these heart-wrenching stories.

Loved ones passed away before family members could ‘comply’ to the stealthily introduced mandatory Covid-19 vaccination.

This, I respectfully argue, became an issue solely because the Australian government mandated vaccinations for workers in the
residential aged care sector.

2)           Invasion of Australians' Privacy Rights in Health Information.




         •    health information as defined as sensitive health information’ by Part II - Interpretation Division 1 - General
              definitions - Section 6 of the Australian government's Privacy Act 7988.The incident highlights a disturbing
              encroachment on the privacy rights of Australian citizens, a clear breach of the Australian Privacy Act 1988.

I urge the Covid-19 Response Inquiry Panel to genuinely reflect on theto comprehend
the widespread public concern over the unjust treatment of an ordinary Australian citizen striving to make an honest living




                      serves as a stark reminder to the Panel of the egregious loss of privacy suffered not only by|________
     but also by countless Australians.

The Privacy Act of 1988, touted as a protector of citizens' rights, has overnight become a meaningless piece of legislation,
providing no safeguard in the so-called "true democracy" that the Australian government champions on the global stage.
3)       Violation of Basic Human Rights

In late 2021 and throughout 2022, Freedom Media WA received numerous reports highlighting instances where Australian
citizens were denied essential services, particularly access to food, at major retail chains.

This denial of service was directed at individuals who possessed legally issued medical certificates exempting them from
wearing face coverings, such as masks, due to various valid health reasons, including:

     •        Severe asthma and acute bronchitis
     •        Mental health illnesses,
     •        diagnosed anxiety, claustrophobia, demagogical disorders like Maskne
     •        Autism

It is our submission, based on the verified stories we were privy too, it revealed a concerning lack of understanding and
sensitivity among shop attendant staff who lacked proper training and empathy, making it difficult for Australian citizens
with lawful mask exemptions to access essential goods and services.


I strongly urge the Covid-19 Response Inquiry Panel to consider the aforementioned issues in the following context:
Australia, known for upholding a strong “rule of law“ reputation.

     •   The Human Rights Commission Act 1986, being the well-established statutory legislative framework
         designed to safeguard the rights of Australian citizens, ensuring equal treatment and freedom from
         discrimination, did little ‘for the people’.
     •   Despite formal complaints (to our firsthand knowledge) made to the Australian Human Rights Commission
         (AHRC), there were significant delays (many months)) in responses to valid complainants,
     •   Five (5) cases brought to our attention, the AHRC cited a lack of appropriate resources as a reason for not
         being able to investigate complaints.

It is our firm submission that delays and resource constraints are wholly unacceptable for the AHRC, the statutory body
entrusted with the explicit mandate to protect the fundamental human rights of Australian citizens.

Such lapses undermine the core principles Australia is known for and must be thoroughly addressed by the Covid-19
Response Inquiry Panel.

Recommendations.


1)       Constitutionally enshrined Bills of Rights


It is my respectful submission and noteworthy that Australia, as a leading western democracy, remains the sole nation
without constitutional protection for the human rights of all its citizens.

In light of this, I implore the Covid-19 Response Inquiry Panel to recognize the significant merit in recommending the
establishment of a dedicated Parliamentary Senate Committee. This committee's exclusive purpose should be the drafting
of a comprehensive 'Bill of Human Rights' to be enshrined in our nation's fundamental "rule book." Such a proactive step
would demonstrate a commitment to upholding and protecting the essential rights of all Australian citizens in alignment
with democratic principles.

                        tful consideration,
