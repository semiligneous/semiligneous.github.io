My name is                       and I am a citizen of Australia who has a personal interest in how Aushgli^gsDQnds
to foreseeable pandemics in the future. The main reason behind my interest is because I suffered a^^^^^^|from
the vaccine and my doctors seemed to turn on me at the mention of a V injury. It has damaged my entire wellbeing
and physical and mental health and career to this day. As a teacher I was provided with a medical contraindication
form and presented this to my employer to have it rejected during the times of the mandates. Since this, I was forced
into a position to question everything about the health advice offered due to the way I was treated by my community,
workplace and government. The reactive response to the pandemic was completely unnecessary and at the end of
the day it was more damaging to the health and wellbeing of the public.

I would like to address the following points for discussion:

Promotion of wellbeing, natural healthcare, and preventive measures are essential components of public health
strategies, especially in the context of preventing and responding to pandemics and other health emergencies. Here's
how these aspects can be integrated into efforts to address global health challenges:

    1.      Wellbeing Promotion:
            • Incorporate mental health and psychosocial support services into pandemic response plans.
                Addressing the mental and emotional well-being of individuals during and after a pandemic is crucial.
            • Promote healthy lifestyles, including proper nutrition, physical activity, and stress management, as
                part of public health campaigns.
    2.      Natural Healthcare and Preventive Measures:
            • Recognise the importance of natural remedies and traditional healthcare practices in some
                communities. Encourage collaboration between modern medicine and traditional healing methods
                where appropriate.
            • Educate the public about natural immune-boosting strategies, such as maintaining a balanced diet,
                staying physically active, and managing chronic conditions to reduce susceptibility to infectious
                diseases.
            • Emphasise the importance of hygiene practices, like regular handwashing and sanitation, as essential
                preventive measures.
            • Include information on the use of vitamins, supplements, and natural remedies, where applicable and
                evidence-based, in public health messaging.
    3.      Preventive Healthcare:
            • Prioritise preventive healthcare measures, promotion of healthy lifestyle choices, screenings, and
                health check-ups, to reduce the burden on healthcare systems during pandemics.
            • Encourage early detection of infectious diseases through routine surveillance and testing.
            • Support research into natural compounds and remedies that may have antiviral or immune-boosting
                properties, contributing to preventive healthcare.
    4.      Collaboration with Alternative Healthcare Providers:
            • Foster collaboration and communication between conventional healthcare systems and alternative
                healthcare providers to offer a holistic approach to health and well-being.
    5.      Public Education and Awareness:
            • Develop public health campaigns that include information about natural and preventive healthcare
                measures to empower individuals to take control of their health.
            • ‘Promote’ vaccination as a preventive measure (do not mandate or force individuals) while also
                acknowledging the role of holistic well-being in overall health.
    6.      Research and Data Collection:
            • Invest in research from an array of health experts (all disciples including natural and alternative
                remedy practicioner's) to evaluate the effectiveness of natural remedies and preventive measures in
                reducing the risk of infectious diseases. Incorporate this evidence into healthcare guidelines. This was
                done in the previous pandemic and totally ignored by the government.
    7.      Community Engagement:
            • Engage with communities to understand their unique healthcare practices, traditions, and beliefs.
                Tailor public health interventions to respect and incorporate cultural and natural approaches to
                healthcare. Do not force people to question their existing beliefs.

Incorporating natural healthcare, preventive measures, and overall well-being promotion into local health efforts can
enhance resilience and preparedness for future pandemics and health emergencies. These strategies should be
evidence-based and culturally sensitive, with a focus on collaborative efforts to improve global health outcomes.


Issues related to guiding future pandemic preparedness and responses:
1.   Tailored Approach to Health Challenges:
     • A "one size fits all" approach to health may not effectively address the unique health challenges that
         each nation faces. Prioritizing individualized responses allows countries to consider their specific
         demographics, healthcare infrastructure, cultural norms, and existing health challenges.
2.   Revisiting Pandemic Plans:
     • The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to revisit and update pandemic response plans.
         Future plans should incorporate lessons learned and ensure they are evidence-based. Measures that
         were found to be ineffective or counterproductive should be re-evaluated, and new strategies should
         be developed.
3.   Funding and WHO Independence:
     • Reconsider the funding mechanisms of international health organisations like the World Health
         Organisation (WHO). Ensuring independence from donor influence can help maintain the credibility
         and objectivity of these organisations.
4.   Balance of WHO Powers:
     • While the WHO plays a critical role in global health, there should be a careful balance between
         empowering the organisation to respond effectively to health threats and ensuring transparency and
         accountability. Measures to prevent undue influence and profit-seeking should be in place. Local
         responses need not align to the WHO one-size-fits-all model of response.
5.   Recognition of Safe Treatments:
     • Encouraging the use of safe and effective treatments alongside vaccines is essential. Recognising
         that individuals may have varying healthcare needs and preferences is crucial for comprehensive
         pandemic preparedness. But it is unnecessary to mandate treatments in order to keep a job or be
         allowed to go out to socialise. What we have learnt is that the vaccine did not stop the spread of the
         disease and its effectiveness was reversed after increasing regular intake. But it should never dictate
         your level of freedom as a citizen.
6.   Ethical Use of Experimental Treatments:
     • Develop ethical guidelines and protocols for the use of experimental drugs, vaccines, and treatments
         during health emergencies. Ensure that individuals provide informed consent and have access to
         alternatives when available.
     • Lessons learnt from covid-19 pandemic. That access to alternative medicines such as ivermectin,
         vitamin d3, zinc, vitamin c, quercetin, etc, were totally ignored by health authorities and governments
         alike. The entire population was placed in a 1 size fits all basket and this did not work out well for
         those like myself who had a horrible advers^eactiorH^h^oisor^HTav^ToUeceived
         compensation and I am still experiencing
                                                                                                           my own
         dollars on treatments and I cannot get any help from specialists as they are afraid that they will lose
         their right to practise under the current restrictions.
7.   Avoiding Enforcement of Experimental Treatments:
     • Mass-scale enforcement of experimental treatments, such as vaccines, to the exclusion of all other
         options should be avoided at all costs. This ensures that individuals have the freedom to make
         healthcare decisions based on their own circumstances and values. The universal one-size-fits-all
         model cannot be applied to a pandemic response. Vaccine injuries are real and people who have
         experienced this have not been support at all by the Australian government or their General
         Practicioner due to being gagged.

         Speaking from experience, my GP was not allowed to test to see if I had an allergic reaction to the
         “vaccines”. I have the evidence on my pathology tests outlining that these tests are not permitted in
         Australia. This is compromising the doctors role to support their patients and provide “informed
         consent”.

         As a result, research supports that the vaccines are actively changing the human DNA - producing the
         spike protein forever because of reverse transcription of the vaccine. Please refer to the research
         paper submitted as evidence to this claim. (Article Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer
         BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line, Autors: Markus
         Alden 1 , Francisko Olofsson Falla 1, Daowei Yang 1, Mohammad Barghouth 1, Cheng Luan 1,
         Magnus Rasmussen 2 and Yang De Marinis 1)

8.   Informed Consent and Bodily Autonomy:
      • Ina free society, the principles of informed consent and bodily autonomy should be upheld as
         fundamental human rights. Individuals should have the ability to make informed choices about their
          healthcare without coercion. From this covid pandemic I have learnt that there was no informed
          consent. I was injured and still injured by the vaccine and was not allowed to make informed consent.
         APRHA/TGA would not allow my doctors to run the correct blood works according to test if I had an
                allergic reaction and if so, what was/am I allergic to now. Since this I have learnt that^^^|and
                           made a few too many shortcuts during approval and administered “contaminated” vials into
                thousands and thousands if not millions and millions of people world wide.

                Lessons learnt. Do not trust the WHO and the UN and we must exit both organisations/businesses
                immediately.


    9.     Historical Context - Nuremberg Code:
           • The Nuremberg Code was established to prevent the abuse of power in medical experimentation. It
               serves as a reminder of the importance of ethics and individual rights in healthcare decision-making,
               particularly during health emergencies.

    10.     Global Collaboration and Data Sharing:
            • Promote international collaboration and data sharing among nations to enhance preparedness and
               response efforts. Sharing knowledge and resources can lead to more effective global health
               outcomes. The government needs to ensure that all points of view, not just following a certain
               narrative is being shared.

                The government censored our media and did not allow for freedom of speech and did not allow
                communities to share their experiences with one another. Instead, we were locked down and fed one
                narrative from all mass media. For these reasons we need to cut all ties with the UN and WHO.
                These organisations are run by unelected people, who have been given the power to control our lives.

    11.     Cultural Competency and Communication:
            • Recognise that cultural competency and effective communication are vital in international health
               emergencies. Responses should be culturally sensitive and inclusive, taking into account diverse
               beliefs and practices.
    12.     Health Equity and Vulnerable Populations:
            • Prioritize health equity and ensure that vulnerable populations have access to healthcare resources,
               information, and support. Address disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.

In sum, a nuanced and comprehensive approach to future pandemic preparedness and responses should involve
evidence-based strategies, respect for individual rights, ethical considerations, and international collaboration.
Recognising the unique needs of each nation and its population is fundamental to a successful global health
response. This is why we need to cut ties with the UN and the WHO. We do not need one governing body to take
control of us regarding the prospects of a pandemic. We do not need the one-size-fits-all approach or a vaccine
passport to dictate how we live our lives. The country needs to promote health and wellness to reduce and eliminate
disease.
