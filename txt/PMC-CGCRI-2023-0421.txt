To The Covid Response Inquiry,

  I am lodging my submission to highlight the unconscionable actions taken by
the Victorian state government under the leadership of Daniel Andrews. I have
 lived in Victori^ovei^^veai^^am ^^^|and have                          have
worked as                            most of those years.
I have never experienced the radical mandates that were implemented during
the years of 2020 and 2021.The mental pressure we saw and personally
experienced was nothing short of brutal and oppressive.
One such mandate was the restriction of people to be allowed out after 8pm at
 night.
Were they inferring that the virus only comes out at night. What craziness!
The lockdowns in Victoria were as you probably know were the longest not just
in Australia but in the whole world. I believe that emphasis of this inquiry
should be heavily weighted to the submissions from Victoria. As you know the
 lockdowns proved flawed as we recorded the highest levels of deaths for any
state or territory in Australia. Follow the science they said and yet there are
 now strong opponents by senior medical professors that say the lockdowns
were injurious to peoples healtMDotlymental and physical._______
One such authority is " D                        a ^^^^^^^^^^|health
 policy expert and a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an open
 letter which challenged the ethics and efficacy of lockdowns, says policymakers
 must do more to mitigate the likely, long-term impacts of Melbourne's unique
 pandemic experience. " quote taken from The Age Sept 24, 2022 this is just a
small portion from article.
I bring to your attention The Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights ; I point
to one of those rights outlined regarding Comments.
The right explains to the patient that they have right to comment on their care
and to have their concerns addressed I would add in a civil democratic manner.
We saw doctors threatened b^Aohi^and their associates with de-registration
I saw personally a doctor in               in^^^^^|where his clinic was
subjected to patient files being removed. And the doctor severely dealt with.
I was concerned about attending doctors surgeries with medical complaints as
I knew the obvious question was are you vaccinated ? Not whether my
symptons were pointing to some other dreaded disease. I know of friends after
attending doctors clinics were ushered out the back into a tent area to be seen
 by a doctor as if they were lepers.
I know of people that spoke out about their concerns and publicly protested
only to be arrested and jailed. Why would I comment at that time with the
justice systems draconian actions on display for all to see.
I have spoken in general terms and just some of the issues we were
confronted with. But there were several others that if allowed I will bring to
your attention.
  I implore this inquiry to upscale to a Royal Commission especially in Victorias
 handling of the Covid 19at your earliest convenience.

Yours sincerely
