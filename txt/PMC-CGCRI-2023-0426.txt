On 21 September 2023, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced an independent inquiry into
Australia's federal response to the pandemic.

I believe in faith, family, life and freedom. In this instance, my stance on freedom meant we stood
against mandatory vaccines and vaccine passports.

Each person has the liberty and responsibility to determine their healthcare in consultation with
their medical practitioners. Sadly, the sacred doctor-patient relationship and our fundamental
freedoms were severely damaged during the past four years.

It was the state and territory governments who were responsible for most Covid policies. However,
the state/territory governments could not have implemented their COVID policies without the
support and endorsement of the federal government.

In this way, the federal government has failed the people. From nurses working in hospitals to our
local trusted GP, we heard mantras about COVID that were not backed by credible evidence. We
heard this to the point that anyone not vaccinated were spreaders and ought to be refused medical
assistance and should just be left to die of they came into hospital.

Even now, there are many who deny the evidence that COVID vaccines were not only ineffective at
preventing people catching the disease, but they also cause adverse reactions.

All officials involved in misinforming the public must be held accountable, and that starts with our
leadership.

We need a Royal Commission into the pandemic response.
