The Albanese government was elected on the promise of a Royal Commission into Australia's
response to the Covid-19 Pandemic, not a watered down Covid-19 Response Inquiry.

The Australians Citizens deserve to know the truth wherever that leads the Royal Commission.

The people will ever accept or be satisfied with the outcomes of this Covid-19 Response Inquiry.

This is will haunt governments until the complete truth be told.

We will never forget.
