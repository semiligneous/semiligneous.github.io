Submission: there is an urgent need for a Royal Commission into all
aspects of the Covid response

This submission asserts the need for a Royal Commission into all aspects of the Covid response that
was implemented by state and federal governments in collaboration with many statutory agencies,
private businesses and community organisations.

The government has a responsibility to conduct a Covid inquiry as a proper investigation is urgently
required. A Royal Commission into all aspects of the Covid response is required as the government
will only face increasing backlash the more time that passes. This backlash stems from a loss of
trust in all levels of government due to questions concerning the numerous negative consequences
of the decisions the government made in adopting their Covid response. These questions have
arisen due to the lack of transparency in decision-making and a lack of transparency in the action
taken before, during and after the onset of the Covid response which, in effect, resulted not only in
the implementation, but also the imposition of technocratic interventions that have relentlessly
attacked the rights of Australians. It has remained clear since the early days of the Covid response,
that these technocratic interventions were never about health. These technocratic interventions
have instead brought about enduring and unethical changes in relation to:
• The practice of medicine, which includes undermining the right of doctors and other medical
   practitioners to facilitate the ability of individual patients to exercise autonomy in making their
   individual decision regarding informed consent without coercion or duress
• The government's adoption of unnecessary and unlawful pandemic prevention-based
   approaches that originated from foreign globalist organisations such as the World Health
   Organisation (WHO) such as 'lock downs', mandating of experimental injections and mask
   wearing, bans on protesting, forcing 'non-essential' businesses (predominantly small and
   medium-sized businesses) to close, and various other restrictions including self-isolation
   quarantine periods of up to 14 days, international travel restrictions, limiting travel zones to a
   5km radius, limitations on time spent outdoors, imposing social distancing and threatening
   businesses and employers with fines if they did not deny unvaccinated people access to medical
   clinics, hospitals, restaurants, shops, hairdressing salons and other community and social places
   and events
• The government undermining the rule of law as well as denying Australians fundamental human
   rights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, freedom of movement and freedom from
   unnecessary government intervention in their lives
• Undermining the separation of powers to impose unprecedented social, economic and medical
   controls overthe Australian people
There is too much to include in just three pages. This is why a Royal Commission into all aspects of
the Covid response is needed so urgently. There are technocratic interventions that are a legacy of
the government's Covid response that are still in place to this day. These must be stopped
immediately AND never allowed to happen again!

Important questions remain unanswered around the following key areas of concern:

• Corruption relating to injection procurement
• Secrecy around contracts including but not limited to contracts between government and
  injection manufacturers, government and pharmaceutical product suppliers and government
  and the legal entities awarded contracts for building quarantine facilities
• The implementation of mask mandates, especially in light of important research on this topic
  from the Cochrane Collaboration highlighting that the evidence of efficacy of N95/P2 respirators
  in slowing the spread of respiratory viruses is inconclusive
• The lack of evidence of efficacy to justify decision-making regarding implementation of
  numerous Covid lock downs, injection mandates, locking unvaccinated people out of essential
  services and community venues to prevent or slow the spread of Covid
• Official advice propagated from the outset of the Covid injection rollout as there was a lack of
  trustworthy evidence that any of the provisionally-approved Covid injections had already been
  proven to be safe or effective as the clinical trial only begun with the Covid injection rollout in
  2021 and the indemnity that the government has given pharmaceutical companies against being
  held financially responsible for the death and injury caused to Australians from the injections
• Unfounded assertions spread by the media, pharmaceutical companies, politicians, bureaucrats
  and celebrities during the Covid injection rollout claiming the injections blocked transmission, or
  prevented or reduced the risk of hospitalization, serious illness or death; no data was available
  then and no data is available now to support such claims
• The government continues to down-play Covid injection injuries including myocarditis and
  pericarditis as well as disregarding the inadequacy of the post injection follow-up duration and
  the potential for injection-related deaths afterthe conclusion of the disingenuously short follow­
  up period
• Media censorship and labelling of Australians discussing narratives regarding Covid injection
  safety and efficacy, other than the 'safe and effective' Covid injection narrative
• Silencing of doctors by preventing them from advising their patients against taking a Covid
  injection, or from issuing a Covid injection exemption to a patient
• The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in the censorship and oppression of doctors including the threat
  of revoking a doctor's license to practice medicine, for example, if the doctor advised their
  patients against taking a Covid injection
• The disgusting denial of compensation to Covid injection injured Australians and discrimination
  against Australians who chose not to take any Covid injections

 The political and bureaucratic heads of government, in collusion with many public agencies,
 community organisations and private businesses, inappropriately mandated and effectively
 coerced law-abiding Australians into subjecting themselves into receiving a course of one or more
 experimental injections under the threat of having their employment terminated, the threat of
 being excluded from participation in society, or seeing family members in hospital, and most
 abhorrent of all the threat of being denied the right to receive life-saving medical care for
 conditions requiring surgical procedures such as some cancer-related treatments and organ
 transplants. The legacy of the injustice from the implementation of Covid injection mandates____
 persists even to this day for some Australians. One such Australian involves the story of

further valid question: if the Covid injections are indeed as safe and as effective as politicians and
government bureaucrats claim, then it should logically follow that fully jabbed patients would be
expected to have sufficient protection due to the Covid injections they themselves have had.

In 2021, the Health Minister Greg Hunt at the time stated in an interview with David Speers from

nearing the end of 2023 and this prompts another question: what is the government doing with the
'enormous amounts of data' that should be available from the 'largest global vaccination trial ever'?
How is the government able to demonstrate the validity of the real world impacts of this program
on population health? In reality the government is yet to provide reliable data that demonstrates
the Covid injections are in fact safe at all. Another important question is what is the relationship
between the effect Covid injections are having on the health of Australians and the increased rate
of unexplained deaths observed in ABS data since the Covid injections rollout?

The considerations raised offer compelling reasons and evidence that many Australians are not
happy and are demanding answers that only a Royal Commission can provide. Efforts by the
government to avoid a Royal Commission into the Covid response strongly supports the assertion
that the government has a lot they are attempting to hide. To preserve what is left of the
government's integrity, a Royal Commission into all levels of the Covid response is needed urgently
and Australia must urgently
