DearC0VID19 Enquiry,

Thankyou for allowing me the opportunity to provide a statement.

My concerns from the COVID19 response from the federal government are financial, namely the
impact that the very high level of financial support provided to both individuals and industry has
contributed heavily to the current inflationary environment.

As a family who were deemed essential workers, we did not receive any benefits from the COVID19
financial support measures, yet we are dealing with the consequences alongside those who did
benefit.

A better coordinated response between federal and state governments reducing the impact on both
high inflation and high government debt would be a great step in future pandemic response. I fear
that the debt created due to COVID19 responses will not be paid back within my lifetime and the
burden will fall on my children, giving their generation an unfair start in life.

A harsh series of lockdowns also took a heavy toll on the mental health of myself and my family,
however I believe that to be beyond the scope of this enquiry, hopefully that can be addressed in
future as there appeared to be little regard for this at the time.

Regards,



Lachlan
