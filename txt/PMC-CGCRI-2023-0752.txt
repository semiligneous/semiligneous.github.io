My submission underscores the necessity for Australia to prioritize proactive measures in
preventing future pandemics rather than solely focusing on preparedness. As a young
Australian, the profound impact of COVID-19 has prompted significant disruptions in my life,
affecting aspects such as education and relationships. I perceived a vulnerability within my
demographic—both socially and economically—leaving us less resilient in the face of
adversities.
While acknowledging the importance of exploring ways the government can enhance
support for individuals and communities during future pandemics, it is crucial to recognize
that even the most well-managed response can result in devastating consequences.
Therefore, the primary objective should be centred around pandemic prevention.
I am aware of the substantial investments made by Australian jurisdictions in hazard
reduction for other natural disasters, particularly in response to climate change. However,
there seems to be a noticeable absence of similar initiatives aimed at reducing the likelihood
of pandemics, despite the evidently higher risk to the average Australian.
In this context, I would like to address several key issues that I believe are pivotal in steering
our efforts towards effective pandemic prevention.
I advocate for the establishment of comprehensive codes of practice and standards by the
Australian government concerning Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), coupled with the implementation
of regulations specifically targeting high-risk spaces. Annually, Australians suffer from
illnesses attributed to exposure to airborne pathogens in indoor settings. The elderly and
immunocompromised individuals, among the most vulnerable in our community, face
heightened risks in such environments. Strengthening controls on IAQ not only bolsters our
defense against current and future pandemics but also mitigates adverse health effects
stemming from other hazards like indoor smog, toxic materials, non-pandemic respiratory
diseases, and other recognized airborne health threats.
Despite Australians spending over 90% of their time indoors, the Australian Department of
Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water notes the absence of specific IAQ
controls, aside from limited regulations specified by Work Safe Australia. Lacking
nationalized standards and codes outlining minimum performance requirements for infection
control, there's a concern that the nation may resort to ineffective interventions that offer
minimal protection against pathogens.
The introduction of clear and effective codes of practice and standards for IAQ in Australia
would establish precise metrics and targets for air quality, aiming to minimize pathogen
transmission. Without such metrics and targets, there's a fear that manufacturers and
innovators might develop products insufficient in purifying indoor air to levels conducive to
reducing pathogen transmission. Establishing evidence-based IAQ standards, informed by
the latest scientific research in respiratory disease, air filtration and sanitation, public health,
and behavioral science, is crucial to creating the right regulatory environment for effective
IAQ interventions available to the Australian public. Additionally, specific requirements
should be outlined for high-risk environments, such as aged care facilities, hospitals,
healthcare facilities, and other places caring for the immunocompromised, where airborne
infections can be potentially life-threatening.
The Lancet COVID-19 Commission Task Force recommends Non-infectious Air Delivery
Rates (NADR) as measurable goals for ventilation and filtration targets to protect against
infectious disease transmission. Acknowledging ongoing scientific debates on optimal
metrics and targets, the Task Force emphasizes the inadequacy of current practices. I
recommend that the Inquiry reviews the Task Force's report to gain insights into setting
effective codes and standards for IAQ.
IAQ codes and standards could be defined by the Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB)
within the National Construction Code. The ABCB could tap into the expertise of the
Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, the Australasian Health
Infrastructure Alliance (AHIA), and leverage existing IAQ work done by the ABCB. ASHRAE
Standard 241, Control of Infectious Aerosols, may also provide valuable insights in
formulating these codes and standards.
I firmly believe that clearer codes of practice and standards for IAQ can safeguard all
Australians against airborne pathogens in indoor environments. With the right regulatory
framework, we can curtail pathogen spread, alleviate the burden on our public health
system, and protect the most vulnerable members of our community.
In exchange for cheap meat from factory farms, people are dying of bacterial infections that
were trivial to treat a few decades ago and facing escalating rates of pandemics that
devastate lives and livelihoods. Simply put, factory farms are pressure cookers in which
nature cooks up novel pathogens. According to the UN, there will be an estimated 10 billion
people in 2050. Without paradigm shifts in industry or culture, I’m concerned that
accelerating demands for meat will only increase and intensify these risks.

Intensive farming practices produce inexpensive meat due to the supposed efficiencies of
increasing livestock density. Animals are being packed closer and closer together in factory
farms, breathing and defecating on top of each other. This environment is a breeding ground
for novel pathogens whose evolution is accelerated by the density of hosts and the
abundance of transmission routes. These practices have a negative public health externality
in both antimicrobial resistance and pandemic potential viruses. The Inquiry shouldn’t stand
for industries that profit by endangering people in Australia and around the world.

Antibiotics are fed to animals to reduce bacterial infections and boost growth - 70% of
antibiotics produced globally are used in livestock, and estimates project that Australia will
see a 16% increase in antibiotic usage in farming over the decade to 2030. This overuse is a
driver of antibiotic-resistant infections globally. In 2020, antimicrobial resistance was
attributed to 1,031 deaths, $439 million in costs of premature death and the loss of 27,705
quality-adjusted life years in Australia (). I understand that the Australian Government has
worked with industry so that its “livestock and seafood industries [have] ... little to no
resistance to antimicrobials”, and these steps should be lauded. However, this same
approach to ensuring intensive animal farming doesn’t risk human lives needs to be
expanded to include viruses - they key cause of pandemics.

Viruses with pandemic potential often originate in wildlife but can cross the species barrier
and pose a catastrophic risk to Humans. Wildlife are natural hosts for viruses that can
persist without causing significant harm to the animals. Occasionally, these viruses can spill
over from wildlife to livestock in farms. In these farms, the viruses encounter new
environments and species, providing opportunities for genetic recombination and adaptation.
This process can enhance the virus's ability to infect and transmit among different hosts,
including humans. The proximity of wildlife, livestock, and humans in certain settings, such
as live animal markets, live exports, abattoirs or factory farms, increases the likelihood of
interspecies transmission events, potentially leading to the emergence of novel and more
transmissible viruses with pandemic potential.
\Ne now know that the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic which caused an estimated 284,000 excess
deaths originated first in swine farms in central Mexico. This quote taken from peer reviewed
paper “Origins of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in swine in Mexico”:

“ This highlights the critical role that animal trading plays in bringing together diverse viruses
from different continents, which can then combine and generate new pandemic viruses. “

Australia needs to drastically decrease the pathogen transmission risks from high animal
densities in live legal or illegal animal trade, live animal exports and factory farming.
Australia’s biosecurity strategies need to require the industry to take practical steps to
reduce these risks. Where the risks remain too great or the prevention of pathogen
transmission is too costly, Australia has a duty to end these practices to avert pandemics
and our slow death from antimicrobial resistance. The late epidemiologist Professor Mary-
Louise McLaws, an expert in infectious disease control and a frequent voice during the
COVID-19 pandemic, said on Channel 10’s The Project:




I think Australia can and needs to do better than Professor McLaws’ prediction.

In conclusion, the imperative to strengthen regulations for biosafety, particularly in laboratory
settings, is a paramount consideration supported by public expectations. The insights from
Gopal et al's analysis in "Securing Civilisation Against Catastrophic Pandemics" underscore
the prevailing risk of dangerous pathogens leaking from labs, emphasizing the need for
robust regulatory frameworks.
The inquiry should not overlook the concerning disparity in biosafety regulations in Australia,
evident in infrequent updates for PC4 facilities and minimal inspections in recent years. This
laxity contributes to a perception among Australians that biosafety is not taken seriously,
warranting an urgent independent review of PCS and PC4 facilities. This review should
comprehensively assess risks, regulatory adequacy, compliance, oversight effectiveness,
and explore measures to enhance public trust and international collaboration.
Turning attention to pandemic preparedness, the momentum gained in diagnostic and
wastewater infrastructure during the COVID-19 response should not be dismantled but
strategically redirected for ongoing public health benefits. This proactive pivot can be
achieved by incorporating clinical metagenomics, wastewater testing, and regular testing at
entry points into routine surveillance efforts, thereby contributing to the National Notifiable
Diseases Surveillance System.
As the inquiry delves into the complexities of diagnostic technologies and early detection
systems, it is crucial to acquaint itself with diverse sampling types and emerging
technologies such as metagenomics, CRISPR-based diagnostics, and PCR/LAMP
advancements. Comprehensive familiarity with cost-effectiveness models and potential
obstacles will guide the formulation of an efficient early detection system.
The pressing need to invest in pathogen-agnostic detection systems is apparent, and the
inquiry should direct the new CDC to explore the benefits of such systems for immediate
public health advantages and their potential as an early warning system against future
pandemics. Recognizing the pivotal role of quick and accurate pathogen detection, this
proactive approach will contribute significantly to the overarching goal of safeguarding public
health in the face of emerging infectious threats.
