In investigating the dynamics behind the Pfizer-Australia relationship, here are some points to ponder: In
order for the Australian Government to comply with its obligations under the Pfizer Agreement, did it
covertly amend its legislation to make clear its position on experimental vaccines?1 Did it negotiate aspects
of foreign debt, put up Commonwealth assets as surety or create a Guarantee Fund by depositing fiat in a
foreign bank account? Let’s do a little digging.


       Pfizer said:                               Australian Government response:


                             ‘...[W]e don't have answers to questions such as whether it gives you one,
                            two or five years of protection’.
                                                                                       Dr. John Skerritt

                            We know that we've got more than enough Pfizer... for population-wide
                            coverage...’

                                                                                      Dr. Brendan Murphy

                            In order to manage a listed human disease, an individual may be required to
                            receive a specified vaccination at a specified medical facility.

                                                                Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth); s. 92(a) and (b)




                            Notwithstanding non-compliance with the requirement to include registration
                            data on product labels (which would ordinarily subject the Sponsor to a fine),
                            civil penalties have been amended and conditions removed in respect of the
                            importation and supply of COVID-19 vaccines.

                                                       Effective 19 February 2021; TGA Act; s. 19D(4)(ba)


                            ‘We don't disclose where our vaccines come from’.

                                                                                      Dr. Brendan Murphy

                            This clause on ‘restricted information’ essentially amounts to a ‘market
                            exclusivity’ and anti-competition provision. It upholds Pfizer’s demand for
confidentiality by protecting data generated by the Sponsor for 5 years and
precludes the public accessing information.

                                         Effective 19 February 2021; TGA Act

Commercial-in-confidence is information that, if released, would cause
competitive detriment. The individual must demonstrate that the information
is not in the public domain; not legally required to be disclosed; and is not
readily discoverable.

arrangement’.

An existing TGA provision on the duty to report medicinal shortages is
complemented by the introduction of a new clause which imbues the Minister
with power to declare a serious scarcity of specified medicine across the
whole, or part, of Australia.

                                Effective 19 February 2021; TGA Act; s. 30EK


The Secretary can give such consent in relation to a vaccine for COVID-19
and avoid the risk that the civil penalties in the Act could delay the
availability of CO VID-19 vaccines in Australia.

                          Effective 19 February 2021; TGA Act; s. 19D(4)(ba)


An Immunisation Register electronically records and stores vaccination data.
                                   The Australian Immunisation Register Act

The TGA confirms a Clinical Trial Registry will be made accessible free-of-
charge to the public. It may be established within or outside Australia.

                             Effective 19 February 2021; TGA Act; s. 26AF(3)


The TGA introduced s.52G sets out exemptions, approvals and prohibitions on
the movement of drugs.

                                 Effective 19 February 2021; TGA Act; s. 52G
In total, 97 alterations were made to the TGA legislation in the current 2020-2021 Pandemic Period. Of
course, the TGA states that legislative amendments are aimed at implementing a level of preparedness.1
                                                                                                     11 This
could be why, as of 9 August 2021; children aged between 12 and 15 years became eligible for the Pfizer
vaccine. Minors with specified underlying medical conditions, children who are Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islanders and children living in remote communities are encouraged to submit to immunisation.111 On one
hand, we don’t want our historically-underrepresented, vulnerable and marginalised indigenous population
absorbing a disproportionate share of the risk; yet you’d think living in a remote community would present
the safest and lowest-risk environment for transmissibility.1V
