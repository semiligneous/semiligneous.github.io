COVID-19 INQUIRY

My main concerns are:
   1) Only one acceptable medical response to this pandemic was to use the unproven newly
      developed vaccination;
   2) Doctors were prevented by medical authorities from exercising selective approach to
      vaccination based on medical condition of patients;
   3)     Multiple cases of adverse reaction and even deaths occurred following vaccination;
   4) Suppression of medical freedom for doctors to use off-label medication to treat COVID-19
      patients;
   5) Use of ineffective and harmful viral medication, such as Remdesivir, to treat COVID-19
      patients in hospitals.
   6) Wide publicity of misleadingly high relative effectiveness of mRNA vaccines and total silence
      on their laughably low absolute effectiveness;
   7) Deliberately false and misleading messages by medical authorities to the public about
      extremely safe off-label medicines, such as Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine. "You are not
      a horse", "It might harm you". By the way Ivermectin is even safer than Panadol.
   8) Consistent denial of natural immunity against COVID-19 for people who recovered from
      COVID-19 in preference of frequent vaccination.
   9) Denial of medical procedures to unvaccinated patients, even in cases of life-saving organ
      transplant surgery.
