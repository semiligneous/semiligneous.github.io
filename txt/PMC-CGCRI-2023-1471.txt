To Whom It May Concern,

I write as a concerned Australian in regards to the overblown pandemic responses by
Australian governments during the COVID years.
In particular:

   •   Our freedoms were trampled upon -
       -   Our choice and bodily integrity was taken from us, with the requiring of
           masks and vaccines - many went along with this in order to keep their jobs,
           or visit loved ones, or just to visit entertainment venues, etc.

       -   Our personal and religious freedoms were removed with restrictions and
           bans on gatherings for families, churches and community groups

       -   Our freedoms of movement, assembly, and autonomy in our everyday lives
           were removed by the totalitarian responses of lockdowns, border closures
           and curfews

       -   Our ability to hold weddings and funerals and be with loved ones in their
           time of need was disallowed

   •   Our human rights were violated - we saw unvaccinated people refused
       medical care at doctor’s clinics, pathology clinics and hospitals

   •   Our medical privacy was breached as people were segregated on the basis of
       their private medical choices

   •   Our society was divided - families, friendships, schools, communities were
       segregated based on people’s private medical choices

   •   Our right to work was lost - people lost jobs, careers, homes, reputations and
       studies due to unfair and unreasonable vaccine mandates

   •       Our economy was deeply harmed -
       -   which in reality, is people’s livelihoods

       -   the needless excessive debt of federal and state government due to severe
           and prolonged lockdowns will continue to hurt Australians for many
           generations; the young have been forced to sacrifice deeply for the sake of the
           old

   •   Our media was hijacked and used to convey only one message of fear,
       discrimination and "you must comply" -
       -   governments and media employed bullying tactics to those not "complying"
           with the forced measures
       -   the resultant fear and suspicion has led to far-reaching breakdown of
           relationships amongst all levels of society

       -   strict media censorship and propaganda was employed to deliberately stifle
           any debate because it might "undermine the Government’s vaccine rollout" -
           this is a disgrace and a worrying reality for any democracy

   •   Our country continues to lose Australians at an unprecedented level of
       excess deaths -
       -   which may have to do with the forced rollout of vaccines which were later
           proved not tested, and neither safe nor effective

       -         the ABS death data was delayed


As a country with such a free, democratic history, and having had innumerable, loyal
citizens who fought for such freedoms - we deserve to have a proper, impartial Inquiry
into all of the governments’ responses to COVID. We must ensure such over-reaches
never occur again.

Thank you for your consideration,
