Submission to the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Introduction:
I am a mid career healthcare professional working as a intensive care paramedic. As a
concerned citizen who experienced significant post-vaccination side effects, I am compelled
to submit my testimony to this Inquiry. My intention is to share my personal narrative and
highlight critical issues related to the healthcare system's response to vaccine adverse
reactions. I believe my experience sheds light on systemic challenges that must be
addressed to ensure a more patient-centric and equitable approach to future public health
initiatives.

Detailed Account of My Experience:
Following my first COVID-19 vaccination with Moderna, soon after I developed moderate
chest pain (5/10) radiating towards my shoulder. This unexpected symptom caused
significant alarm and prompted immediate contact with emergency services. The urgency of
my condition was evident, leading to prompt referrals to a cardiologist. Despite undergoing
extensive investigations, including stress echo and serial ECG assessments, definitive
diagnoses remained elusive. While the tests revealed borderline troponin levels, the
persistent pain and lack of conclusive explanations have had a profound impact on my
mental and physical well-being. My confidence in my cardiovascular health has been
significantly eroded, leaving me with lasting anxieties about my future health.

Analysis and Connection to Inquiry's Terms of Reference:
My experience resonated deeply with the Inquiry's focus on assessing the effectiveness and
fairness of the Commonwealth's COVID-19 response. The dismissal of my concerns
regarding the potential link between my symptoms and the vaccine reflects a broader
systemic issue within the healthcare system. This dismissal exemplifies a concerning lack of
individualized care and a tendency to downplay patient experiences, particularly when it
comes to reporting adverse reactions to vaccines. This undermines transparency and trust in
public health initiatives, potentially discouraging individuals from seeking necessary
vaccinations.

Recommendations:
To address these concerns and ensure a more equitable and patient-centered approach to
future public health interventions, I propose the following recommendations:

   1. Individualized Assessment of Vaccine Reactions: Any adverse reaction, regardless of
      severity or perceived rarity, should warrant a thorough investigation and
      individualized assessment by qualified healthcare professionals. This personalized
      approach allows for the identification of potential risks and ensures that patient
      concerns are heard and addressed appropriately.
   2. Recognition of Natural Immunity: Prior COVID-19 infection should be recognized as a
      valid form of immunity, offering equivalent protection to vaccination. This
      acknowledgment empowers individuals and promotes informed decision-making
      regarding vaccination, particularly for those with concerns about potential side
      effects.
   3. Mandatory Reporting of Vaccine Concerns: To enhance transparency and improve
      data collection, healthcare providers should be mandated to record and report all
       patient concerns about vaccine side effects. This data can play a crucial role in
       identifying potential safety signals and informing future vaccine development and
       rollout strategies.
    4. Transparent and Comprehensive Clinical Trials: Fostering greater transparency in
       clinical trial reporting, including the publication of anonymized individual-level data, is
       essential to building public trust and facilitating informed decision-making regarding
       vaccination. This increased transparency can address concerns surrounding
       potential biases and promote a more inclusive approach to vaccine research and
       development.

Conclusion:
My experience signifies the urgent need for a healthcare system that prioritises
patient-centered care, transparent communication, and individualized assessments,
particularly when it comes to public health initiatives. By acknowledging the realities of
vaccine side effects, implementing the proposed recommendations, and actively engaging
with patients, we can cultivate a more empathetic and inclusive healthcare system that
prioritizes the well-being of all individuals. This shift is crucial not only in restoring public trust
in vaccination programs but also in shaping a more equitable and effective approach to
managing future public health challenges.
