Democracy & accountability in the
pandemic
    Democracy & Accountability Program submission to
            the CO VID-19 Response Inquiry

Bill Browne
December 2023



Introduction
Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission to the COVID-19 Response
Inquiry. Given the Inquiry's broad remit, it is not surprising that The Australia
Institute's Democracy & Accountability Program has carried out significant research
into topics that might be of interest to the panel. This submission outlines how these
research papers come under each of the Inquiry's terms of reference.

The Program would welcome the opportunity to discuss research findings in further
detail.



GOVERNANCE
          Term of reference 1: Governance including the role of the Commonwealth
          Government, responsibilities of state and territory governments, national
          governance mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination
          Mechanism and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and
          advisory bodies supporting responses to COVID-19.



National Cabinet
The pall of secrecy cast over National Cabinet documents and deliberations was wholly
unnecessary and damaging to public trust. In some cases, such as the bifurcation of
energy policy responsibilities, it led to uncertainty and duplication.

The role of state governments
Australia's states and territories took the lead in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic,
supported by constitutional powers and popular mandates. Australia Institute polling
research found that Australians rated their state or territory government as doing a
better job than the federal government. The paper below asks if Australia's federal
nature may have contributed to its relative success in managing the pandemic. It also
elaborates on the concerns with National Cabinet and how it could be improved or
modified going further.

        response and beyond, https://australiainstitute.org.au/report/state-revival/



Parliamentary scrutiny
In March 2020, New Zealand adopted the Epidemic Response Committee to provide
for parliamentary oversight of the government's COVID-19 response while the
Parliament was not sitting.

The Australia Institute and the National Integrity Committee of former judges urged
the Parliament of Australia to follow New Zealand's example. Some 17,900 Australians
signed an Australia Institute petition calling on the Australian Parliament to create a
New Zealand-style multi-partisan select committee to enable proper accountability
and scrutiny of the government's COVID-19 response. Australia Institute polling
research found that two in three Australians supported Australia setting up a New
Zealand-style parliamentary committee.1

In April 2020, the ACT established the Select Committee on the COVID-19 Response
and the Australian Parliament established a Senate select committee to provide
parliamentary scrutiny. The Australia Institute welcomed the establishment of the
Senate committee.2

That month, prominent Tasmanian individuals and organisations signed an Australia
Institute open letter calling for an equivalent committee in Tasmania.3 In May and June
2020, Tasmanian crossbenchers endeavoured to establish an oversight committee.4 In
2022, the Tasmanian Public Accounts Committee held an inquiry into the Tasmanian
Government's continuing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.5

Diminished state capacity
Consultants took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to further entrench private
advice in public decision making.6 Australia Institute research identifies concerns with
the advice given by consulting firms during the pandemic, and places these concerns
within the wider context of a general trend of consulting firms contributing to poor
government decision-making.

Inappropriate use of defence reserves
Allan Behm, the head of the Australia Institute's International & Security Affairs
Program, criticised the securitisation of major domestic policy problems and the
militarisation of public policy management in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.

         militarised, https://www.smh.com.au/national/operation-khaki-creep-why-
         public-policy-management-is-being-militarised-20210801-p58ern.html



HEALTH RESPONSE MEASURES
        Term of reference 2: Key health response measures (for example across COVID-
        19 vaccinations and treatments, key medical supplies such as personal
        protective equipment, quarantine facilities, and public health messaging).



Public attitudes to the COVID-19 pandemic response
In May 2020, the Australia Institute surveyed nationally representative samples of
people in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the US, Italy and South Korea about the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Australians and Americans were equally the most likely to report having already lost
their jobs and the least confident of keeping their jobs, but Australians maintained
high trust in government compared to their American counterparts. New Zealanders

In January 2021, the Australia Institute surveyed Australians on whether Prime
Minister Scott Morrison had a responsibility to clearly and publicly criticise a federal
Liberal politician who posted misinformation about the pandemic on social media.
Three in four Australians agreed (77%), including as many Coalition voters (77%).

The Australia Institute's exit polling following the 2022 federal election asked
respondents about 20 issues in the context of whether they were a strength or
weakness for the Morrison government. Half of Australians (48%) identified the
government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as a weakness, 22% as neither, and
30% as a strength. However, the Morrison government scored even worse on most
issues than it did on its handling of COVID-19.

       the election, https://australiainstitute.org.au/report/exit-poll-2022/



SUPPORT FOR INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS
       Term of reference 5: Support for industry and businesses (for example
       responding to supply chain and transport issues, addressing labour shortages,
       and support for specific industries).



Arts and entertainment
The arts and entertainment sector was unnecessarily, illogically and cruelly neglected
in the support provided to industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the
performing arts were badly affected by COVID-19 restrictions, and polling research
found that three in five Australians (58%) supported the industry's request for a $750
million federal relief package for live performance.

       Browne (2020) Art vs dismal science,
       https://australiainstitute.org.au/report/art-vs-dismal-science/

The neglect of the arts and entertainment sector occurred despite the sector's
economic importance and its high level of exposure to the pandemic's economic
consequences. Conservative estimates were that, prior to the pandemic, the sector
employed 193,600 Australians and contributed $14.7 billion to Gross Domestic
Product.

In 2021, the Australia Institute's Centre for Future Work identified the ongoing,
devastating impact of COVID-19 on Australia's arts and entertainment sector and
made recommendations to government to reboot the creative sector after the crisis.

       entertainment sector after COVID, https://futurework.org.au/report/creativity-
       in-crisis-rebooting-australias-arts-and-entertainment-sector-after-covid/



The ABC
Australia Institute polling research in 2019 and 2020 found that an increasing share of
Australians agreed with the general proposition that the ABC's funding should be
increased (35%, vs 12% who thought it should be reduced). When the additional
funding was associated with the ABC's emergency role, support rose dramatically to
three in four Australians (75%).
