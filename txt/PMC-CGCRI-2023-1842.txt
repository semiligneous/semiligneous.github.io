To whom it may concern:

I am a molecular biologist with expertise in messenger RNA technologies and next-generation
sequencing, and a broad interest in biological risk management and the power of emerging life
sciences technologies to shape the world. I am writing this submission from the perspective of an
educated and interested citizen; these opinions are my own, and this submission does not represent
my employer.

Firstly, I would like to strongly agree with the case raised by other submissions to this inquiry that
Australia should focus on primary pandemic prevention, rather than merely pandemic response. An
alternative way to conceptualise this is a stronger focus on preparedness to respond to diseases with
pandemic potential at the earliest possible stage, before they become widespread and disrupt social
structures as happened in 2020-22. During COVID-19, we all became familiar with the 'Swiss cheese'
metaphor, as applied to pandemic mitigation111: each measure (such as vaccination, test-and-trace,
masks, sanitation, movement restrictions) prevented some transmission events, and together these
measures collectively reduced the disease burden on the community. Similarly, the 'Swiss cheese'
model can be applied to primary pandemic prevention and early mitigation: measures such as
biosecurity improvements for animal agriculture12,31, separation of livestock from wildlife141,
surveillance for novel pathogens15-71, and enhancements to indoor air quality in places where many
people gather or pass through18-111 could collectively reduce the likelihood that a pathogen with
pandemic potential will emerge or spread. I endorse the submissions made on this topic by Good
Ancestors Policy and Australians for Pandemic Prevention, and I deeply hope that you will consider the
strength of both their scientific and economic arguments for a stronger focus on pandemic prevention
as we try to learn from COVID-19.

Secondly, I would like to highlight the remarkable potential of messenger RNA technologies for coping
with future pandemics. The genome sequence for SARS-CoV-2 was first made publicly available by
Chinese scientists on January 11, 20201121. Within merely 2-4 months, multiple vaccines were beginning
emergency Phase I clinical trials113,141. The rapid pace of vaccine development in response to the COVID-
19 pandemic was of course dependent on unprecedented international collaboration and funding for
research, and the nature of the emergency warranted greater haste and more information sharing
than is typical during early vaccine development. However, the defining feature of the unprecedented
speed of the vaccine response was the application of messenger RNA (mRNA) technologies. Vaccines
based on mRNA have multiple advantages that make them uniquely powerful in a rapidly-changing
pandemic situation. Other vaccine technologies (including the use of purified protein, assembled
protein complexes, killed pathogen, or live-attenuated pathogen) all require the sequential
optimisation of several challenging laboratory steps, even in the earliest preclinical stages. Protein
production and purification must typically be optimised for each individual protein115,161, which means
that high-throughput screening of multiple antigens from the pathogen of interest may take months
to years to accomplish. By contrast, production of synthetic mRNA is a straightforward process which
is methodologically extremely similar regardless of what the mRNA encodes1171. High-throughput
screening of different antigens (eg, different proteins encoded by the pathogen, plus isolated domains
or fragments of these proteins) is feasible and can be conducted by any suitably-equipped laboratory
with access to the pathogen's genome sequence; there is no requirement for access to the pathogen
itself or suitable biosafety facilities and PRE with which to work on it. When mRNA vaccine candidates
are ready for clinical trials or even for production and emergency usage as happened during COVID-
19, we can once again benefit from the relative simplicity of large-scale mRNA manufacture, as well as
the fact that mass deployment of ANY mRNA vaccine has virtually identical infrastructure, personnel
and distribution requirements. This stands in powerful contrast to the specialised facilities and
expertise which are required to scale up production of many vaccines using a more traditional proteinÂ­
based or whole-pathogen-based formula. The speed and adaptability of mRNA-based vaccine
development was demonstrated multiple times during the pandemic, with the release of updated
booster vaccines based on the sequences of COVID-19 variants that emerged later; the importance of
these developments to the ultimate control of the pandemic is still an area of active research and
debate1181.


When considering the potential benefits of mRNA technologies for future pandemic prevention and
response, we should also take into account other advances in mRNA technology besides the
development of new vaccines. For instance, Australian researchers are working on quality control
measures for mRNA vaccines1191 and ways to enhance the stability of mRNA vaccines so they are easier
to ship and store. As a scientist working in this field, it is difficult to overstate the amount of
international interest in this technology and the hope and enthusiasm that we feel towards its
potential. I strongly believe that maintaining and increasing Australia's investment in mRNA research
and mRNA production and testing facilities will both enhance the likelihood that we can rapidly
respond to emerging pandemics, and provide Australia with self-sufficiency for vaccine manufacture
in the event of another global pandemic like COVID-19. Enhancing our understanding of and ability to
apply this emerging technology should be considered a critical infrastructure investment for Australia's
future.

This brings me to my third point: Australia's future pandemic strategy must include a strong focus on
emerging technologies, and periodic review of technological advancements that can improve our
ability to both prevent and respond to pandemics in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise
to a wave of technological innovations that could prevent or mitigate future pandemics, but many have
not yet reached full maturity and a fair assessment of their cost, feasibility and effectiveness cannot
yet be carried out because research and development is ongoing. Some examples are widespread
metagenomic surveillance15-61, enhanced air cleaning for indoor spaces191, far-UVC sterilisation1111, and
even baking disposable respirators to allow them to be reused in an emergency situation1201. In addition
to this, the rapid pace of emerging artificial intelligence technologies poses both risks and
opportunities in the pandemic response and pandemic prevention space. For example, artificial
intelligence has made overwhelming advances in the past 2-3 years in the prediction of protein
function from protein structure121-221; this could be combined with environmental or wastewater
metagenomic data to identify novel pathogens with far greater sensitivity and specificity than is
currently possible, and would significantly shift the cost-benefit analysis for implementing an
expensive prevention measure like widespread metagenomic surveillance. Ongoing advancements in
GPU technology are both driving and being driven by the Al revolution123-251 and these are also highly
relevant because of the likelihood that workflows currently limited by availability of compute resources
(again, metagenomics) will become significantly more feasible to implement. I strongly suggest that
Australia's pandemic strategy should include a direction to periodically reconsider measures which are
scientifically plausible but not currently proven, feasible or cost-effective, because of the likelihood
that ongoing technological development changes the evaluation of their usefulness to the community.

I hope that the content of this submission is of interest and value to the inquiry. Thank you for the
opportunity to provide comment.
