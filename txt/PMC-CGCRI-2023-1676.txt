COVID-19 Response Inquiry - Questions
The current inquiry into the Government’s handling of COVID-19 is a waste of taxpayers money.
Its terms of reference should be asking much more serious questions. The following are just a few.


   •   Why did Australia's health officials and Government not fulfil their duty of care to verify if
       there was actually a health threat?
   •       Why was the COVID-19 virus never isolated and proven to exist?
   •   Why did Australia’s health officials and Government take their orders from the WHO an
       organisation headed                                Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and
       funded by^^^^^J Bill Gates?
   •   Who is Jane Halton really working for? She has worked with the WHO related Coalition for
       Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and COVAX initiative. She participated at Event 201
       which table topped a corona virus pandemic only weeks before the supposed real one, and
       then was made head of the COVID-19 Coordination Commission.
              Deputy Australian Statistician andformer Victorian Chief
       Health Officer also should be investigated for their roles.
   •   Why did the Government indemnify the pharmaceutical companies for an unproven and
       largely untested vaccine? Who approved this?
   •       Why is there no investigation into the excess deaths since the vaccine roll out?
   •   Why did NSW Minister of Health, Brad Hazzard and Chief Health Officer, Kerry Chant
       state that the COVID-19 measures were related to the New World Order?
   •       Why did the Government ban proven alternative treatments for colds and flus?
   •   Why did the Government and its officials allow the PCR research tool to be the indicator of
       illness when its inventor, Kary Mullis, stated that was a research tool not a diagnostic tool?
       Why was an ineffective RAT test used?
   •       Who made financial gains from the pandemic?
