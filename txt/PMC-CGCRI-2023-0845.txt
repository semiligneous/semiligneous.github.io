Since my 3rd covid shot, first booster, in February
2022,1 have developed a^^| Two GP's and a
Dermatologist told me it was just ^^^^and
gave me a number of ointments and creams which
had minimum success. I was also told I needed
more sun on my skin as well as moisturiser.


I have been active as a surfer my whole life and
have plenty of sun and post surf moisturiser, but
these claims were not really taken seriously.


The Dermatologist told me I had picked up a

countered by repeating I had this^Hsince
February 2022.
