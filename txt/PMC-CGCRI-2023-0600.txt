To whom it may concern

My Family and I have been adversely impacted by the government's response to the Covid
pandemic.

My^^H and I could not work because we chose to listen to the many medical experts throughout
the world that warned of the harmful side effects that the Covid vaccine could do. And there were
certainly not enough clear evidence for us to have an informed decision. My ^^Jalso lost her job
due to mandates created by her employer/the government. A dedicated teacher of 30 years was now
deemed with Gross Misconduct.

      admitted that their injection does not stop transmission. The data shows clearly that people
who took the injection still got Covid. Clearly it was not effective. The whole premise of the
mandates were that the injections were to stop the spread.

Excess deaths in countries that rolled out these vaccines are
skyrocketing, but we are still encouraging and even forcing our citizens to have more. They
need to be stopped immediately. And the government misinformation needs to be held to
account.

We need to get to the bottom of the campaign waged against those who chose not to take the
shots by the government and the media. We were publicly vilified by both and treated like
lepers. What sort of country has Australia become that this is acceptable?

I strongly request a full Royal Commission and proper investigation into the whole sorry saga,
that continues to unfold, even now.

Respectfully
