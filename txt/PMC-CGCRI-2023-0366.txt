I believe that Australian should not have this new level of involvement that the WHO is proposing. It
is completely unnecessary and will hinder our right to freedom of choice as individuals.

I believe Australian need much more unbiased information and to have the choice over the health
and wellbeing.

I believe this signing of this document will be an intrusion on our national freedom and nations
identity.

I say no to the WHO having any involvement in our health.




We are sovereign beings and we are capable of taking care of our own health in times of crisis.




Thank you.
