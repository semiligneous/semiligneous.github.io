Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission to this Inquiry. The main purpose of this
submission is to highlight relevant research publications and reports generated during the early
years of the COVID-19 pandemic to support public health policy making and responses, and to
outline some of my roles and responsibilities during this time.

I am an Australian general practitioner, primary care and public health researcher, and clinician
leader. Since July 2023, I have held a joint academic appointment as the inaugural Director of the
Centre for Future Health Systems at the University of New South Wales, and as Professor of Global
Primary Care and Future Health Systems at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences
at the University of Oxford. During the first three and a half years of the COVID-19 pandemic, I
served as Deputy Chief Medical Officer and Principal Medical Advisor with the Australian
Government Department of Health and Aged Care, and as the Foundation Professor of Primary Care
Reform at the Australian National University.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, I worked with the Australian government, the Minister
for Health and Aged Care, and colleagues and stakeholders from across the nation on many key
initiatives including the rapid implementation of whole of population telehealth measures. I was a
member of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) providing health advice to
the Prime Minister and National Cabinet throughout the pandemic. I chaired a cross-Department of
Health taskforce to ensure rapid deployment of oral COVID-19 treatments. I chaired the
Commonwealth's Aged Care Advisory Group, providing advice on the prevention and response and
recovery of outbreaks of COVID-19 in residential aged care facilities. I worked with the Presiding
Officers of the Parliament of Australia, the Chief Justices of the High Court of Australia and the
Federal Court, and the staff of the Australian Electoral Commission, to support the COVIDSafe
approaches of these core national institutions. I was a member of the Industrial Relations Taskforce
of the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission, established to support the continuation of
essential industries throughout the pandemic. I was appointed as a health advisor to the Office of
the Attorney General to support the resolution of industrial disputes affecting essential industries
during the pandemic. I was appointed by the Office of the Foreign Minister to support the pandemic
responses of other nations, including Papua New Guinea, Tonga, and Vanuatu. I participated in
meetings of the COVID-19 Vaccines and Treatments for Australia - Science and Industry Technical
Advisory Group which provided advice to the Australian Government on the purchasing and
manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. I represented the Department of Health and
Aged Care as a member of the Australian COVID-19 Palliative Care Working Group providing advice
to ensure the safe continuation of palliative care services throughout the pandemic. I supported the
establishment of stakeholder advisory committees to support input into pandemic responses from
members of culturally and linguistically diverse communities and from people with disability. I hosted
webinars each week for health care workers, reaching an audience of up to 15,000 live viewers at
each event, issued weekly update newsletters by email and social media to the nation's healthcare
workers, and participated in numerous other webinar events supporting healthcare, aged care and
disability care workers across Australia and around the world. I chaired a regular forum to provide
updates for media commentators from key representatives of the Australian Government
Department of Health and Aged Care and to allow the exchange of knowledge and experience. I
appeared regularly on mainstream media outlets providing updates and explaining elements of the
national pandemic response to the people of Australia. I served eight periods as acting Chief Medical
Officer of Australia and Director of Human Biosecurity.

I also co-chaired the National COVID-19 Health and Research Advisory Committee (NCHRAC), with
                             which was established in March 2020 to provide advice to the
Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer on aspects of Australia's health response to the COVID-19
pandemic and which conducted reviews of international research and other sources of evidence to
     support national policy decisions. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
     provided secretariat and project support for the Committee through its operation from April 2020
     until 31 March 2022.

     NCHRAC membership included representation from all states and territories and from rural and
     remote Australia. Members were selected to provide a range of expertise and perspectives, and
     included:
          •           respected community leaders and parliamentarians
          • clinicians and researchers from a variety of disciplines, including infectious disease, public
              health, emergency response, hospital care, primary care, social science and bioethics
          • persons that represented the voices of older people, people with disability, Aboriginal and
              Torres Strait Islander people, younger people, people of culturally and linguistically diverse
              backgrounds, and people with mental health concerns.
     Details of the NCHRAC, its membership and copies of its 40 published reports are available at:
     https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/leadership-and-governance/committees/national-covid-19-
     health-and-research-advisory-committee

     I also led a team of action researchers from The Australian National University, based with me in the
     Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care, documenting the development and
     implementation of the nation's primary health care response to COVID-19, and carrying out rapid
     research reviews to inform national policy developments. Some of this work was published in the
     medical literature, to share our findings with other health care providers and policy makers around
     the world and to ensure there was an enduring record of aspects of Australia's response to support
     future pandemic planning and responses. I have added below details of some of the publications
     from this team which are relevant to the terms of reference of this Inquiry. Please let me know if I
     can further assist the work of the Inquiry. I would be happy to appear in person if requested.
