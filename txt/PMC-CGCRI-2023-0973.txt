. In January 2020, my father was admitted to an aged care facility in^^^^H By March 2020 due
to Covid protocols, the aged care facility stopped allowing any visitors to enter the facility. All
events and excursions for the residents were cancelled. My mother, my sister and I were only
allowed Zoom calls as contact with my father. We were only allowed to visit him in person when
end of life became imminent in January 2021. The isolation my father experienced from not having
us visit was unjustifiable cruelty.

. In January 2022, I was forced on long service leave due to vaccination mandates in my
workplace                           My job was advertised and given to a new employee. I
extended my leave until the mandates lifted and was allowed back to work. I could not longer do
my job as that position had been taken. I was redeployed to another job that was unsuitable so I
was made redundant. I am still not employed to this day.

. My husband was coerced into being vaccinated by his employer due to his workplace enforcing
vaccine mandates.

. My son was coerced into being vaccinated by his employer due to his workplace enforcing
vaccine mandates.

. My daughter was coerced into being vaccinated by her University enforcing vaccine mandates
and her employer enforcing vaccine mandates.
