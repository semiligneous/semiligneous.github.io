     Submission and evidence to the Covid-19 response Enquiry.

My Submission falls in the relevance of a Broader Health Support and concerns the
Western Australia practice of not being able to have a qualified nurse, or doctor attend
to a person in their home to be given a vaccination for the Covid-19 pandemic.

                 had 5 separate occasions that required Covid-19 vaccinations, due to
he


There were 2 occasions when I had to cancel my wifeâ€™s appointment to get the Covid-19
vaccination due to her not being well enough to get out of bed.

My wife was in a My Aged Care package at level 4 and the qualified nurse who was
treating my wife on a weekly basis could not administer the Covid-19 vaccination as she
was not insured by the My Aged Care company to do so.

Apart from the Covid 19 vaccinations,     had to be taken to the surgery for her Flu and
6 monthly injections due to thin bones. Having to go through the same worrying saga
and painful episodes to my 87 years old wife and myself as husband and carer.

Apparently in the mentioned instances the My Aged Care supplier and the doctors
surgery,also including the local chemist can only administer injection/vaccinations on
their premises to be covered by their insurance.
