I hope that the Inquiry will recommend:



1. Acknowledgement of the problem
As Professoi^^^^^^^^| says, there are things that we can and should do to reduce the harm that
covid is causing. But the first step is acknowledging the problem, so that people understand why it is
important to do things differently.

There is so much research that shows that every covid infection causes damage to every body, even in
people who are young and healthy. The evidence on this has been clear, for a long time. Here are a
couple of examples from 2020 and 2021, showing cognitive damage and damage in children’s blood
vessels, including in those who have “recovered” from a mild infection:

kD4ZJhTZY

There is so much research that demonstrates these concerning consequences. I trust the Inquiry will
take into account this evidence and recommend a change to Australia’s mindset of complacency about
covid.



2. Sharing knowledge about how covid actually spreads

Current health advice tells people to wash their hands or use hand sanitiser to prevent infection. This is
useless against an airborne virus.

It is so sad to see elderly people at the supermarkets wiping down the handles of their trolleys (which
does nothing to prevent covid) when they are not wearing a mask (which could protect them). So many
organisations have notices about their efforts at covid “safety” which are directed to cleaning hands or
avoiding touching surfaces. Imagine the improvements to transmission rates if those efforts were instead
directed to improving air quality. For many places, this would be as simple as opening windows.

I find it difficult to ask non-experts to take the simple steps that would actually reduce transmission
when there is no knowledge about airborne spread. Most people who run businesses want those places
to be safe for their customers and employees. Most schools want their students to be safe. They are not
taking the actions that would actually keep people much safer because public health has failed to inform
them about how covid spreads.



3. Clean air standards

With better knowledge about airborne spread, ventilation could be improved in public places. State
governments should take responsibility for upgrading ventilation in schools and hospitals. (Nobody
should feel unsafe accessing healthcare. This requires masking in healthcare at a minimum.) But the
Federal government has a role in setting standards for public places. Belgian air quality legislation
provides a good starting point:

4. Better vaccine availability for everyone (including children)

Recent research showed that older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional
protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses
received:

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.24.23300512vl

Australia needs to move much more quickly to make available the latest vaccines, and to open up
eligibility to all who want them. Evidence demonstrates that these are needed at least every six months
to not fall too far behind the changing variants. Even if we had to pay for them privately, we would be
very happy to do so.

ACIP, the US equivalent of ATAGI, published the evidence in support of its recommendation of making
everyone over six months old eligible for the latest vaccines - including taking into account longer term
effects of covid, not just acute hospitalisations and death. This evidence is persuasive.

For children, the evidence they relied upon shows the must higher burden of covid hospitalisations for
covid compared with other diseases for which immunisation is compulsory in Australia. As a parent,
Australia’s restrictive approach to covid vaccination seems utterly bizarre to me:

Annual hospitalizations per 100,000 population prior to recommended vaccines compared to COVID:

More than half of children hospitalised for covid had no underlying medical conditions, and the
percentages were highest in younger children:

This evidence demonstrates the inappropriateness of Australia’s recommendations: those under five
without risk factors cannot access any covid vaccines, despite having higher levels of hospitalisation
for covid than older children, and high levels of hospitalisation without pre-existing risk factors. This
approach needs to change.

There is no reason to think that Australians are any different from Americans in terms of health impacts.
We would all benefit from timely access to current vaccines, including our youngest children.
Last month I tried to access an updated                                   but was refused as ineligible (I am
          with no health conditions and already had a booster earlier in 2023). Just days later I caught
my first covid infection. It is unfair that I had to face this without the benefit of the most recent vaccine.

Recent research shows that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid by about 70%:

https ://www. Cambridge, org/core/j oumals/antimicrobial-stewardship-and-healthcare-
epidemiology/article/effectiveness-of-covidl9-vaccine-in-the-prevention-of-postcovid-conditions-a-
systematic-literature-review-and-metaanalysis-of-the-latest-
research/AOB 115B5D3 AA60846799857B801D116E

We should take into account these longer term impacts and not just assess vaccines against acute
hospitalisations and deaths.

It seems to be generally accepted that the lesser impacts of covid today are due to levels of immunity
from vaccinations and previous infections. Omicron is not inherently milder (hence, for example, the
terrible impact in Hong Kong where many of the elderly were not adequately vaccinated). So my
unvaccinated, uninfected^^^^^^^^l is in the same position as                       in 2020 - completely
unprotected. Australia made great efforts to protect everyone then, yet nothing is done for him now. At
the very least, he should be eligible for the vaccines that have been approved as safe and are shown to
be effective in other countries, where children are allowed to access them.



Thank you for consideration of this submission.
