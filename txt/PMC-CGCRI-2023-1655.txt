The covid response, from start to finish, involved abysmal human rights abuses which must
never be repeated. This means that the WHO pandemic treaty must be rejected.

Firstly, scientifically designed pandemic plans were completely thrown out in favour of
autocratic nonsense                                        namely lockdowns. These entailed
the criminalisation of ordinary living, mass house arrest and a police state. Experimental,
ineffective "vaccines" and useless masks were coerced, which constitutes medical abuse and
a bodily autonomy violation. That Australian authorities did this to their constituents is
shameful and despicable. There should be a reckoning and those involved should face
justice.

The dangers of covid were also greatly exaggerated. Fear propaganda was used to encourage
acceptance of draconian measures. Australian governments behaved in ways reminiscent of
historical tyrannical regimes, rejecting basic human rights principles and the liberal
democratic ones on which our country is founded. Parliaments were shut down.
Governments pressured social media into censoring its critics. Protests were met with
violent police repression. This was a dark period in Australia's history and there must be
accountability for it in order to prevent its ever being repeated under any pretext.
