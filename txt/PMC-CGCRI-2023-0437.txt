I am horrified at the response of the Commonwealth Government to COVID. We
need an urgent enquiry into the Commonwealth governments COVID policies
including :

       1       .Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts

      2 .Mandates (which are within the Commonwealth terms of reference as (1)
      the Commonwealth mandated jabs for aged care. (2) the Commonwealth
      enabled jab mandates with their data sharing arrangements with the states
      and vaccination databases, and (3) the Commonwealth failed to act to protect
      Australians human rights from the States and private businesses abuse and
      coercion.

      S.Vaccine injuries

      4            .Mask mandates and lockdowns

      5 .Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to
      block infection and transmission (the government later admitted the Covid
      jabs never blocked the transmission or infection from Covid) along with denial
      of vaccine injuries and gaslighting of the injured

      6            . National border closures

      7 . The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable
      harm of the vaccine and their action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical
      Profession.

We need a full Royal Commission and proper investigation into these issues and not
the Covid enquiry whitewash that is being proposed.




Yours sincerely,




Kate Murray
