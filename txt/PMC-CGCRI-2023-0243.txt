As an elector and Australian born
citizen. I demand that a royal
commission be held to address the
following issues.

* corrupt vaccine procurement
* secret contracts with vaccine
companies
* mask mandates
* lockdowns
* vaccine mandates
* official misinformation and lies in
the media regarding the ability of
vaccines to block transmission
* vaccine injuries
* media censorship
* silencing of doctors
* the roll of AHPRA and ATAGI in
censorship and oppression of doctors

* the poor treatment of victims

To build a relationship of trust with
the Australian public these matters
need to be addressed with a Royal
Commission
