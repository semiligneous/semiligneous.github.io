To the COVID-19 Response Inquiry Panel,

Subject: Request for a Royal Commission to Investigate
COVID-19 Response Measures

Introduction:

I                a concerned citizen, personally affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic response. I am writing to advocate for
the establishment of a Royal Commission to conduct a
corrjprehehSive and independent investigation into the various
aspects of the pandemic response, particularly those that have
had direct impacts on individuals like myself.

1. Necessity for a Royal Commission:

The complexities and nuances of the pandemic response
cannot be fully encapsulated by the current inquiry. A Royal
Commission is imperative to uncover the truth and provide a
platform for those affected to be he^rd.

2. Vaccine Procurement and Secret Contracts:

Transparency in vaccine procurement and contract disclosures
is essential. The public deserves to know the details of
agreements that have such far-reaching implications on their
health and wellbeing.
3. Mask and Lockdown Mandates:

A thorough examination of the decision-making process behind
mask and lockdown mandates is needed. These mandates
have had profound social and economic effects, and their
efficacy and impact warrant a complete review.

4. Vaccine Mandates and Media Misinformation:

The implementation of vaccine mandates and the role of media
in spreading information, or misinformation, about vaccines
need to be critically examined. This includes assessing the
accuracy of information regarding vaccine effectiveness in
preventing transmission.

5. Personal Experience with Vaccine Injuries:

As someone who has suffered adverse reactions from the
mRNA vaccine, I can attest to the significance of these issues.
It's crucial that vaccine injuries are not only acknowledged but
thoroughly investigated. Support and assistance for those who
have suffered as I have are urgently needed.

6. Censorship and Silencing of Medical Professionals:

The potential suppression of medical opinions and the roles of
organizations like AHPRA and ATAGI in the censorship of
healthcare professionals should be rigorously investigated to
uphold the integrity of medical discourse.

7. Treatment of Victims:

The response to individuals who have been adversely affected
by pandemic policies or vaccine side effects deserves careful
examination. Their experiences and the adequacy of support
provided must be scrutinized.
Conclusion:

A Royal Commission is the only avenue capable of undertaking
an investigation with the depth and breadth required for these
complex issues. The Australian public, including those of us
who have been directly impacted, seeks transparency, justice,
and accountability from our government.

Attachments:

I trust that the Panel will consider this submission with the
seriousness it deserves and recognize the imperative need for
a Royal Commission.

Sincerely,
