MY THOUGHTS

“SO THE LORD SENT NATHAN THE PROPHET TO TELL DAVID
THIS STORY “THERE WERE TWO MEN IN A CERTAIN TOWN.
ONE WAS RICH, AND ONE WAS POOR. THE RICH MAN OWNED
A GREAT MANY SHEEP AND CATTLE. THE POOR MAN OWNED
NOTHING BUT ONE LITTLE LAMB HE HAD BOUGHT HE
RAISED THAT LITTLE LAMB, AND IT GREW UP WITH HIS
CHILDREN. IT ATE FROM THE MAN’S OWN PLATBAND DRANK
FROM HIS CUP.

HE CUDDLED IT IN HIS ARM’S LIKE A BABY DAUGHTER. ONE
DAY A GUEST ARRIVED AT THE HOME OF THE RICH MAN. BUT
INSTEAD OF KILLING AN ANIMAL FROM HIS OWN FLOCK OR
HERD, HE TOOK THE POOR MAN’S LAMB AND KILLED IT AND
PREPARED IT FOR HIS GUEST.”

DAVID WAS FURIOUS. “AS SURELY AS THE LORD LIVES,” HE
VOWED, “ANY MAN WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING
DESERVES TO DIE! HE MUST REPAY FOUR LAMBS TO THE
POOR MAN FOR THE ONE HE STOLE AND FOR HAVING NO
PITY

THEN NATHAN SAID TO DAVID, “YOU ARE THAT MAN!
