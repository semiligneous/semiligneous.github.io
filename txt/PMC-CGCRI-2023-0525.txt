Submission for the Covid Inquiry from the Office of the PM & Cabinet 2023

https://www.pmc.qov.au/covid-19-response-inquiry/consultation

We are in an urgent need of a Royal Commission investigation into:

   •   Covid 19 vaccine procurement and secret contracts
   •   Mask mandates
   •   Lock downs
   •   Vaccine mandates: Safe & Effective lie?
          o "Mo ore will be safe until everyone is vaccinated." Pfizer admitted to
                           ■that they never tested if the jab stopped
              transmission. The vaccines didn’t stop transmission.
          o   Why were employees made redundant if they didn’t take the not so
              effective vaccine which was evident very shortly after the vaccine
              roll out.
          o   The government kept with the same message advertising on
              mainstream media: “Get vaccinated to protect others” but it was
              clear that wasn’t the truth. People were made feel safe where they
              shouldn’t have been safe.
          o   Vaccinated & tested positive people were able to move around
              freely, yet they were passing the virus on. Again this was evident
              very early on, yet no changes were made.

             misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of
             vaccines to block transmission
          o
   •   Excess death: Australia has a unique scenario regarding being able to
       pinpoint a direct correlation between no covid appearing in Australia
       from May 2021. During the same time (March 2021) the rollout of Covid 19
       vaccines started with the goal to vaccinate all “willing” people by 2022.
          o The excess deaths started to rise in 2022 and continue to rise in
             2023. See separate attachment: Excess mortality as a percentage
             above expected by jurisdiction 2020-23. Source: Source: Australian

             the COVID-19 pandemic until the first quarter 202319/07/2023
          o Never in history, have we had excess deaths after a pandemic.
             There are more people dying now than during the pandemic,
             eventhough 95% of the population got vaccinated. Safe & effective
             was the mantra given out by the government and mainstream
             media - a lie?

       o   The percentage of dying people is much higher under the
           vaccinated people. The government
       o   The excess death rate is higher not because of people dying with or
           Covid. So, why are there so many people dying. More than during
           Covid?

•   Media censorship
•   Nobel prize winning medical products such as Ivermectin where taken off
    the shelves during the pandemic and labelled as ‘dangerous horse
    dewormer’ by the mainstream media. Since the prodigious drug donation
    operation began in 1987,1.5 billion treatments have been approved and
    with over 112.7 million people being successfully treated yearly.
       o With an early treatment proven to be working reducing the
          symptoms of Covidl9, emergency powers couldn’t have been
          implemented.
       o   Ivermectin was administered in many countries during the Covid
           pandemic and proven to be effective:

       o
•   Silencing of doctors & stripping medical registration from doctors who
    didn’t agree with the narrative.
•   University of QLD were given government grant to rush through a safe &
    effective C19 vaccine. It failed their first trial. Vaxine (lead by|
              | produced a safe & effective protein-based Covax-19 vaccine yet
    the Australian government turned a blind eye and put roadblocks
    wherever they could. It’s the first synthetic protein vaccine against Covid-
    19 to receive market authorisation, after showing protection against the
    Delta virus variant in a Phase 3 clinical trial in 16,876 subjects in Iran. This
    vaccine is not available in Australia till today.
•   The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors
•   The poor treatment of victims (vaccine injuries).
•   Restricting free speech worldwide:

            related-posts-after-pressure-from-the-white-house-report-620413

•   Further to that, the deadline set for the Covid Inquiry submissions from
    the Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet is too short and suggests that
    this is clearly deliberate and appears intended to be a complete
    whitewash. Why?
