Covid-19 response inquiry submission from Dr Rosemary Faire
https://www.pmc.gov.au/covid-19-response-inquiry/

Short Intro about myself
My training and work life as an academic have encompassed fields of biological sciences (PhD),
psychology (BSc), psychotherapy (Cert), expressive arts therapy (GradDip) and somatic/
movement education (MA). I have taught biology and research methodology at tertiary level.
Politically I was a Greens supporter, climate activist with Citizens’ Climate Lobby, and an ABC
news consumer until 2021. All that changed when the serious lying about COVID treatments and
the injections by government and medical “experts” became obvious to me as a former biologist.

I am sending in this submission because I’m giving you, as a member of the “independent” panel,
the benefit of a doubt that you are genuinely interested in “inquiring” rather than merely
supporting/justifying the Approved Narrative.

I am probably wasting my time if you are unwilling or incapable of facing the cognitive dissonance
and discomfort which all those who peek behind the curtain experience, or if you have been
instructed not to accept the evidence from experts who have been conveniently labelled as
“conspiracy theorists” or “antivaxxers” for daring to question the COVID orthodoxy.

...’’Specific areas of review may include, but are not limited to...”

From your list of terms of reference:
- COVID-19 Vaccinations: anyone who has been paying attention knows there have been huge
  issues around safety, efficacy, adverse event monitoring which have been raised by experts
  from Australia and overseas; for example, I refer you to the testimonies of Australian and
  international experts in the book Too Many Dead produced by the Australian Medical
  Professionals Society after their event in Canberra recently https://amps.redunion.com.au/too-

- COVID-19 Treatments: banning by TGA of early treatments (the ivermectin debacle was so
  obviously a takedown of a treatment by WHO and other regulators using manipulated meta­
  analysis httDs://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2ju5v4TAaQ and other excuses; our Australian
  expert on drug development and experience with TGA, Dr Phillip Altman, repeatedly exposed
  the TGA ban to be unscientific httDs://DhilliDaltman.substack.com/D/oDen-letter-to-the-tga-
  regarding):
- COVID-19 Treatment protocols requiring doctors adhere to treatments such as ventilation,
  remdesivir and DNR pathways that caused iatrogenic harm to patients in hospitals; I have no
  direct experience of what went on in Australian hospitals thank goodness, but my doctor did
  tell me that they were using remdesivir, a drug with known deleterious effects on renal function;
  even the bizarre instructions given to the public about there being “no treatments” and to stay
  home and wait until their symptoms worsen sufficiently to be hospitalised, departed so strongly
  from ANY previous medical guidelines that they must be investigated fully as to their origin and
  motivation (aka, the obvious one of selling the “vaccines” down the track); Deadly hospital
  protocols - 25 commonalities from victim testimonies: httDs://chbmD.org/commonalities/ :
- Public Health Messaging - censorship in MSM of every perspective except the government
  Narrative; outright lies in messaging (“dangerous horse pill”; “Safe & Effective”; “vanishingly
  rare” adverse events); messaging was downright abusive (Abuse psychology, Meredith Miller:
  httDs://www.bitchute.com/video/CATXk9Dry80o/) of those who, like myself, had many
  justifiable reservations about the safety of the mRNA/gene therapy platform being used as
  “vaccines”;
- Securing vaccine supply deals: there was NO transparency, secret deals were done, pharma
  go’s given indemnity, how many tax payer dollars were spent on injections and what are the
  kickbacks for those making these decisions? We all know there is a revolving door between
  regulators and Big Pharma.
- Addressing labour shortages: mandated injections (scientifically fraudulently justified as the
  shots did not prevent infection or transmission) meant many workers were sacked; most of
  these people were not ever reinstated (revenge for disobedience?) but rather workers imported;
- The global experience and lessons learnt from other countries in order to improve response
  measures “in the event of future global pandemics”: excess deaths are still being ignored
  around the world; our Australian Senate voted against an inquiry into Australian excess
  deaths; WHO is about to take full control via the amendments to IHR and pandemic treaty, so
  that in their “future pandemics” our sovereignty will amount to nothing and we will all be at the
  mercy of whatever madness the WHO dictates.

More terms of reference from my list:
- WHO declaration of “pandemic” amounts to a dictatorship by one man who heads up an
  unelected group with huge financial conflicts of interest due to funding asymmetries; we saw
  this clearly in the Monkeypox fiasco;
- Previous pandemic planning over decades was thrown out in 2020 - how and why and who
  was behind this? If it was a military run biosecurity emergency rollout of countermeasures, why
  was it masquerading as a public-health-regulated-by-TGA rollout?
- PCR tests have been shown to be totally inappropriate as a diagnostic tool; not only do they
  produce false positives when run at the commonly used but ridiculous 40-cycles, but they
  could easily have been picking up homologies with previous coronaviruses; Dr Sona Pekova,
  Czech Republic, Day 3 Nuremberg 2.0: httDs://zeeemedia.com/interview/grand-jury-day-3-
  pcr-test/ (Please note: if you look at a link and straight away judge it to be “conspiracy” without
  actually hearing the expert testimony, then you have succumbed to a very efficient
  Psychological Operation - think about it: if you were trying to tell the truth about something
  which governments were censoring, wouldn’t you go to “underground” media too, because no
  one else would allow you to speak? If you really are conducting an Inquiry, you won’t put expert
  testimonies in the bin before even listening to them.)
- Censorship of scientists and doctors who critiqued the responses - MSM and social media
  tech giants obeyed government dictates to censor and propagandise the government
  message; httDs://blog.rebekahbarnett.com.au/D/breaking-the-australian-government colluded
  with big tech to suppress speech on Covid; Canadian testimony by Rodney Palmer Full
  interview Day 1 Toronto on media propaganda: httDs://nationalcitizensinquiry.ca/toronto-cliDs/:
  Marianne Klowak’s testimony on CBC, National Citizen’s Inquiry: https://rumble.com/v2ojxea-
  former-veteran-cbc-reporter-testified-that-the-broadcaster-betrayed-the-pub.html:
- AHPRA went after doctors and psychologists who practiced individualised medicine, gave
  honest opinions of risk/benefit, prescribed safe early treatments, warned against harms of
  injections, supported the Nuremberg Code (Nuremberg Code: https://media.tghn.org/
  medialibrary/2011/04/BMJ No 7070 Volume 313 The Nuremberg Code.pdf). Helsinki
  Declaration and their own doctors code of conduct regarding informed consent;
- Gaslighting by the medical profession, politicians, media, of the people injured after the
  transfection injections; obvious to anyone paying attention. Even Dr Keryn Phelps!

Testimonies from the Vaccine Injured:
The vile suggestion that such testimonies are from people who misattribute their injuries to the
impeccable “Safe&Effective-vaccines ” is insulting to people’s intelligence and unacceptable,
especially given the number of people who report such injuries. Given the social ostracising of
families and individuals who have spoken up about such injuries, I would think it highly likely that
these testimonies are a small fraction of the real toll.

My personal experience of friends injured by the injections: truth in science comes in many
forms, although the RCT-hegemony of late has brainwashed some into believing these are the
only valid form of evidence; having taught research methodology I know that there are many valid
ways in which scientists gather evidence, and these even include anecdotes and personal
testimonies. I have already mentioned the young man whose heart has been severely affected, so
much so that he was suicidal. He was gaslit by many doctors at first, until the evidence was
undeniable. He is still undergoing a slow recovery. In addition, one of my close friends was injured
in 2021 by her first AstraZeneca injection - she had a severe immune response affecting her skin
and other areas, but her doctors gaslit her to the extent that they refused to give her an exemption
for a second jab; outrageously they then suggested she get the mRNA jabs; fortunately she has
not had any more since that first one and I am extremely grateful, having monitored the
inadequate but still alarming TGA adverse events reports.

Dear Inquirer: I am extremely grateful that despite the lies, cover ups and media propaganda,
there have been ethical doctors, scientists, psychologists, lawyers and journalists, some of whom
I know personally, who have been prepared to sacrifice their careers/reputations to tell the truth. If
those on this inquiry are half as ethical and brave, and actually read submissions like mine rather
than binning them, Australia is not entirely lost.
Sincerely,
Dr Rosemary Faire, PhD
