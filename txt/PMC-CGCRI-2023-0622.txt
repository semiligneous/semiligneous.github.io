                          Submission To Covid-19 Response Inquiry



I am a family man and a self-employed business operator approaching retirement age I am
based in Central Queensland where I have lived for most of my life. I and many of my family
contracted Covid during the course of the pandemic which was confirmed by RAT or PCR
(irrespective of vaccination status of the individual) and we were deeply concerned by the
restrictions placed upon the community and the consequential damage from both a
financial and mental health perspective.

I submit that the Terms of Reference of this inquiry are deficient in so much as those Terms
of Reference exclude investigation of actions taken at all levels of Government particularly at
a State and Territory level.
Most of the actions of Government in matters of health are State and Territory
responsibilities and therefore exclusion of this area of investigation does not provide for a
true picture of the response to the so-called pandemic.

I further submit that the Terms of Reference exclude investigation of any accusation of
action, including coercion and vilification of individuals or groups, to comply with directives
or policies of government.
Such coercion and vilification, including threat of or actual dismissal from employmentmay
amount to infringing upon a number personal and constitutional rights and thereby be
criminal and/or subversive action by the Government generally and by Members of
Parliament and of the Public Service bodies of State, Territory and Federal governments
specifically.

Finally, I submit that the Terms of Reference exclude investigation of the validity of the
classification of the Covid-19 event as a pandemic, the true level of its severity and any
subsequent direct or indirect health consequences of the treatments or treatment policies
promoted or mandated by Government.
As statistical and report-based evidence mounts it is flawed methodology to not investigate
these areas of public concern and to have the Terms of Reference focus on how the various
Government bodies and their agencies acted in many cases without evidence of the need to
act in the particular way they acted.
