I on behalf of 300 of my fellow health care colleagues who have been discriminated
against and lost our jobs, strongly request a proper Royal Commission for a proper
investigation into; corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts; mask mandates;
lock downs; vaccine mandates, official misinformation and lies in the media regarding
the ability of vaccines to block transmission, vaccine injuries; media censorship, silencing
of doctors, the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors, and
the poor treatment of victims.

We deserve and demand answers. Covid-19 didnt wreck our lives and nation - the
management of it, the censorship and dictatorship, taking of freedom of choice and our
own bodily autonomy, the division the government created and the COVID- 19
VACCINES did.

The Australian people are not going to bend over again for something like this. So it is in
your best interest to do the right thing and investigate properly. A proper Royal
Commission. So that things can be done the right way next time, and not repeat the
history that caused enormous heartache and devastation to our Australian Nation.
