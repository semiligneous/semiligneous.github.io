COVID-19 Response Inquiry

12/12/2023

It is my concern that the Covid-19 situation was a great over reaction. Complete with a testing
system that was not reliable, and by chance happened to be enough in stock to test the whole
world at the first sign of the virus. To add to that the already existing medications that were
showing to be effective in treatment being removed from the system to make way for the
vaccines roll out. Which in a very short time showed signs of adverse reactions and should have
been pulled from the system until completely test and proven to be safe and effective, as it is
with most other medications that come on the market. Not pushed and pushed to cause increased
harm to the population.
