I have taken the time to put together some thoughts and answers to some questions regarding the
"pharmaceutical" that our government, industries and colleagues are currently "advising" us to
receive.
I've attempted to use where possible reputable links and factual data, all the while acquiring this
from the world's most common internet search engine - Google.
I call it a "pharmaceutical" as it is not actually a vaccine per se, such as those administered for Polio,
Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), Chickenpox etc. These traditional vaccines are attenuated or
inactivated viruses, or proteins exhibited by the virus, which elicit a natural broad spectrum immune
system response to the virus as a whole which exhibit many (dozens) of antigen proteins to the
body. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen. Each of these proteins/antigens become recognisable
to the immune system and result in a broad long-term immunological memory.
The efficacy (ability to prevent the disease) of these traditional vaccines are recorded to be around
the 95% range (with decades of lasting protection), see the official data from the Center for Disease
Control & Prevention (known as the CDC)
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html ,
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/varicella/hcp/about-vaccine.html &
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/effectiveness-duration-protection.html


What is the pharmaceutical being administered for SARS-CoV-2?
In Australia we currently have two types of pharmaceuticals being administered and they both act by
physically entering our body's cells to produce just the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen of a specific
strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus it's coded for. These spike proteins are then meant to be exhibited on
the host cell's wall. Our immune system seeing the spike antigen then mounts a response to the host
cells, which are attacked and destroyed by our immune system as a normal virus would be. This
results in a temporary (months to a year) immunity through antibody and memory B & T-cell
production to that form (strain) of spike protein as encoded in the mRNA.

How long does the currently administer pharmaceuticals in the fight against SARS-CoV-
2provide immunity?
The studies are ongoing as the pharmaceutical is still in the experimental phase, and detailed studies
are difficult to find on Google based search engines which I've chosen to use for this exercise. The
current research has shown that the durability of the antibodies produced wanes significantly over
time. See the Time Course of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Binding and Neutralization Responses after
mRNA-1273 Vaccination https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2103916. This short lived
immunity is in stark contrast to the classical vaccines for Mumps, Measles, Rubella, Polio and the
like.

This states that of the 469 people that were infected at the fair 74% were fully 'vaxed', no one died
and only 5 people ended up in ICU of which 4 of the 5 were fully vaxed.
It's quite the possibility that the pharmaceutical don't work as promised and possibly could make
future infections worse in due course as a result of a phenomenon known as Antibody Dependant
Enhancement, see Antibody-dependent enhancement and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapies |

Additionally if no one died out of 469 then the virus doesn't appear that deadly, 89% of the cases
were the "Delta" variant.

Personally I'm deeply concerned that ADE might occur in future mutations of the SARS CoV-2 virus.
Those that received the Dengvaxia whose immune system hadn't seen Dengue Fever before were
those at risk of ADE.

How deadly is the virus in the most vaccinated nation in the world?
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/israel/ 7205 deaths to 1117596 cases = 0.6%,
and out of the entire populace of 9.45M equates to 0.076% and Israel has medium density living
with the land mass of Israel being 22,145 square km. The land mass of NSW is 801,150 square km (36
times Israel's) with a population of 8.16M (which is commensurate (1.3M less people in fact) to
Israel's population). Likely spread of the disease would therefore be less given the greater natural
social distancing. As of 16:30pm 07Sept21 NSW has 193 deaths to 36267 cases., that's 0.5% death
rate, not dissimilar to Israel's 0.6%. When assessed across the entire population of NSW that's
0.0023%.


How did countries with a lax approach to the disease fair?
Sweden is a prime example of a 1st world country and it's density of living is 25 people/km whereas
Australia's is 3 people/km
https://www.statista.com/statistics/525530/sweden-death-rate/The mean death rate in 2020 was
9.6/1000 people and was beaten by 2012 @ 9.7/1000 people.

Do masks really work to reduce infection?
A Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection
Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541)
https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m20-6817 A total of 3030 participants were randomly
assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control (no mask); 4862
completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks
(1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%).
The CDC cites dubious "real-world" information regarding the effectiveness of the masks, with no
"control" groups in any of the cited reports. While the DANMASK-19 study is not the pinnacle of
epidemiological studies it has significantly more scientific merit than that cited by the CDC where the
first cited report is based on hair salon in Springfield MO in the USA.


Is it wise to vaccinate the entire population?

Surely a wise approach would be to allow those in the higher risk 50+ age brackets to voluntarily
take the 'vaccine', not the entire populace including teenagers and children who statistically have no
chance of dying from the disease, but the available data has shown there is a real possibility of
suffering adverse effects from the 'vaccine', even death. The CDC itself reported on the 1st of Sept
2021 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.htmlB

See the attached report from the Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Database of
Adverse Avent Notifications (DAEN) report generated on the 21st of August 2021
      •     Number of reports (cases): 46438
      •     Number of cases with a single suspected medicine was the cause: 45778,
      •     Number of cases where death was a reported outcome: 448
Since the virus entered our nation, there has been 1167 deaths with SARS-CoV-2 over the last
ISmths https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-
alert/coronavirus-covid-19-case-numbers-and-statistics. The pharmaceutical has been readily
available for 6mths now and there has been 448 cases where death was a reported outcome from
receiving it. You can see that if the pharmaceutical had been administered for ISmths (3 x 6mths),
the same length of time the virus existed in Australia, that the number of reported deaths arising
from it would likely equate to 3 x 448 = 1344. This is 117 more people than what the virus has
reportedly resulted/influenced the death of. Obviously there has not been millions of Australians
exposed to the virus that we know of but it's still food for thought. I suspect that the number of
people that were exposed to the virus would be 4 times the case rate, but they didn't develop
symptoms, were immune or didn't bother getting tested.

Are there other readily available drugs that can help reduce the infection rate and if the
disease is contracted its severity?
Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 cheap and readily available drugs have been trialed throughout
the world, particularly in countries with lower economic capacities.


Ivermectin is a well-known, FDA-approved anti-parasite drug that has been used successfully for
more than four decades to treat onchocerciasis "river blindness" and other parasitic diseases. It is
one of the safest drugs known. It is on the WHO's list of essential medicines, has been given 3.7
billion times around the globe, and has won the Nobel prize for its global and historic impacts in
eradicating endemic parasitic infections in many parts of the world. Our medical discovery of a
rapidly growing published medical evidence base, demonstrating ivermectin's unique and highly

Closing statement:
If you feel you should take the pharmaceutical based on your physiology, age, health concerns and
are comfortable with it, you are rightfully entitled to do so. If you consider your innate immune
system to be strong or are uncomfortable with the pharmaceutical and are unsure about it all, don't
submit to it. I note that taking a vaccine is irrevocable, you can't just stop its impact on your health
such as a course of antibiotics, oral medicines, topical medicines or intravenous drugs should you
begin to see side effects. It's for this reason that much caution and extensive research should be
done by the pharmaceutical companies, governing bodies, medical practitioners and even the
individual. We MUST NOT be driven by fear.

Forcing others to believe as you do, regardless of your fears, either way, I find that to be
unacceptable.
Implementing a vaccine passport and restrictions in our society based upon the receipt of ANY
pharmaceutical is abhorrent and discriminatory.
The following pivotal documents aim to prevent such measures:
