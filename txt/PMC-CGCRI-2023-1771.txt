I                                                     as follows:-

    1.    At the time of my vaccine injury (December, 2021), I was^jyears old. I had suffered a
                       injury 20 years prior but was a successful owner operator of an
          business.
    2.    During the covid pandemic, it became evident that I could not conduct my business without
          having received the vaccine. I couldn't enter retirement villages or shopping centres without
          it.
    3.    3 weeks after my 2nd Pfizer vaccine, I felt unwell and began experiencing stroke like
          symptoms. Soon after I was admitted to the^^^^^^^ospital, I was diagnosed with a TIA,
       heart palpitations, and heart arrhythmia. It was told to me at the time that the covid vaccine
       was the likely contributor.
    4. Since that time, I have been taking what I now know will be lifelong medication to manage
       my heart.
    5. Up until the time of the covid vaccine, I was an otherwise healthy^yo male who ran his
           own business. As a result of the TIA, I experienced further cognitive decline and the
          worsening of previous non-serious underlying health conditions. Because of the nature of
          the covid vaccine and the health system, I feel everything was downplayed.
    6.    I truly regret receiving the covid vaccine and believe that the government should have
           protected people like myself by providing further information/warnings about the possibility
           (however small) of underlying health conditions worsening with the vaccine or at least that
          there would be no guarantees that further health complications may arise as the vaccine was
           untested.
    7.    ^^^^^^^who was^yo at the time of her vaccine injury also had major health
          complications after just one vaccine reacted with her adversely. The hospital at the time
          attributed it to the vaccine and she has experienced ongoing health issues ever since. Being
          diagnosed with MAST cell activation and a plethora of health conditions she has had to cease
          work in her^^^Jbusiness which is what she absolutely loved and lived for. I know that
          there are hundreds of thousands of young people just like her who have become disabled by
          the vaccine activating underlying health conditions.
    8.    The government now has a duty of care to ensure that the community is never mandated
          again to receive a vaccine which is otherwise untested, particularly on young bodies.
    9.        I never wish to see this page in history repeated.
