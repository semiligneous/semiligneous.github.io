The Covid vaccine mandates affected me the most. I wanted to keep working and felt coerced to get the vaccines to keep
my job. I have had vaccines previously but this one was definitely experimental and think it was irresponsible for the
government to support rolling this out let alone mandating it. Highly unprofessional of Government that didn't look at
medical professionals on both sides of the debate instead of calling anyone against the safety of the vaccine
'misinformation spokespeople'.
