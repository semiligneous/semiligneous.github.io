COVID 19 ENQUIRY



The terms of reference of this enquiry need to be broadened to include the action by State
Governments, government agencies (both State and Federal), Police departments, health officials,
the TGA and private organisations.

The closing down of small enterprises while allowing large companies to continue to operate was
immoral, draconian and must certainly government overreach.

The arresting and fining of people was an abomination and a total absurdity in a so called free and
democratic society.

The undue forcing and encouragement of people to take unproven mRNA vaccines borders on a
criminal act by both Federal and State governments. With evidence now becoming apparent that
these vaccines were ineffective and in a number of cases caused death and adverse medical
outcomes for a number of people. Normally evidence of dangers to the health of people from any
medication would have resulted in it becoming deregister from being administered to humans. Yet
criminally, in my opinion, it is still being promoted for people to take.

The making of the taking of these untried, and now questionably unsafe vaccines, mandatory was
both unnecessary and an invasion of people's rights to either accept or reject medical advice. People
have the right to make their own decisions on the medical treatment they consider is best for
themselves.

Also the removal of the use of medications, approved for human consumption, was unnecessary and
was direct cancellation of our medical professional's right to treat people as they deemed to be in
their patient's best interest. This seemed a direct move by the TGA to ensure the take up and use of
mRNA ever though they were an unproven medication.

The current funding model of our so called independent TGA needs to be amended so that their
total resourcing comes from the government and not in any way from pharmaceutical companies.
