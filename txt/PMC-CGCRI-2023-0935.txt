COVID inquiry submission



Thank you for the chance to comment on the COVID inquiry.



I would like to state that I am opposed to the removal of our freedoms by
governments. These removal of freedoms relate to mask mandates, vaccine
mandates, lockdowns, and curfews. Freedom of speech was also affected.
People who had opposing views were silenced or arrested. This is unacceptable



The restrictions that were placed on people, the loss of freedom to choose to
vaccinate or not. The loss of work and jobs was unaccepatble.



Australians deserve a real COVID inquiry that will look into all aspects of how
the 'pandemic' was handled

The Inquiry does not delve into the unilateral decisions by state and territory
governments, which deeply impacted our daily lives. The Inquiry's impartiality
is also in question, some of the panel members have shown previous support
for restrictive measures which they are now scrutinising.... This should not be
allowed
