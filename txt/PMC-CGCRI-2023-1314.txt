Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to submit my feedback on the Federal
Government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the limited timeframe for
response, particularly during the busy holiday season, I appreciate the chance to express my
concerns. Please excuse the brevity of my responses.

1. Failure to protect against discrimination based on vaccination status:
Living in^^^^^H, I made an informed decision not to get vaccinated based on my health
status and age, relying on actual scientific information. Regrettably, I experienced
discrimination in both the workplace and society. The Federal Government's rejection of the
COVID-19 Vaccination Status Prevention of Discrimination Bill 2022 and the Fair Work
Amendment Bill 2023 left individuals like me unprotected, leading to stress, income loss, and
enduring mental health challenges.

2. Wasteful spending on vaccines:
The Federal Government's procurement of 255 million vaccines, with only 60 million used,
resulted in a wasteful expenditure of approximately $3 billion on vaccines not used. The
decision to acquire ten times the population's needs raises questions about the allocation of
funds and responsible financial planning.

3. Blocking access to effective treatments:
The government's refusal to acknowledge treatments with substantial evidence, such as
Ivermectin, potentially contributed to preventable loss of lives. Limited access to proven
therapeutic options represents a significant flaw in the pandemic response.

4. Neglect of health improvement strategies:
The emphasis on social distancing without promoting health improvement measures, such
as regular exercise, weight management, and vitamin D testing, was a missed opportunity.
Focusing solely on preventive measures without addressing overall health leaves a critical
gap in the government's approach.

5. Lack of Cost-Benefit Analysis:
A transparent cost-benefit analysis of the government's COVID-19 response is
conspicuously absent. Without such an assessment, the risk of perpetuating ineffective
spending practices persists. Conducting a thorough analysis is essential for learning from
the current situation and refining future responses.

6. Changes in pandemic response plans:
The deviation from the pre-COVID pandemic management plan (AHMPPI) raises concerns.
Reverting to a more sensible and evidence-based approach, as outlined in the AHMPPI, is
recommended for future pandemics. The current pandemic response should not serve as a
blueprint for future crises to avert potential disasters.

I appreciate your consideration of these points and hope they contribute to a more
comprehensive evaluation of the government's pandemic management strategies.
