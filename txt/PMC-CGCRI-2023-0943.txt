To whom it may concern,

Please accept my brief submission.

                                                     Due to the Covid 19 restrictions and
lock downs I was unable to get the much needed proper medical attention and counselling
for my husband, that he needed.




                                                               Our lives have been
irreparably damaged.

I do not believe for one minute the restrictions or lock downs were necessary.
