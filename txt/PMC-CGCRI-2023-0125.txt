Submission to the enquiry regarding Covid 19.



Specific point: vaccine mandates



The vaccine mandates had no basis in science. It was published information in December 2020
clearly indicating that vaccines would have no significant impact on virus transmission nor infection.
It was eventually revealed that endpoints of transmission and infection were not studied as part of at
least the Pfizer vaccine trials.

Despite their ability to past legislation to prevent vaccine mandates, the Commonwealth government
sat back and allowed states to implement^^^^^| vaccine mandates which have had a devastating
impact on the community and individuals.

No other aspect of Covid management is more significant than this issue. Australia is a signatory to
various instruments, dating back to post-World War II which should have prevented these actions.
The people responsible for implementing the vaccine mandates must be held accountable. An
honest and just Parliament would indeed do so. Failure to prosecute said people will simply indicate
to Australian citizens that their parliament is neither just nor honest.

Thank you
