Ridiculous Situation in South Australia during 2022, where unfounded/unscientific govt policy caused
unnecessary harm and distress to children and families.

Situation as at March 2022...

My ^^^^^^Bjaughter is now no longer able to compete at Athletics SA events at the SA Athletics
OUTDOORS Stadium at^^^^|as they are now requiring everyone over the age of 12 (and soon over
the age of 5!?!) to have received Covid injections in order to enter stadium and compete. Yes,
mandating injection for children. For an open air outdoor sport. With experimental, emergency
approved gene therapy therapeutic that does not reduce transmission at all, and comes with more risk
for children than they are at from covid itself. I understand this disgraceful and discriminatory mandate
decision by Athletics SA was driven by its funder, the SA Office of Recreation & Sport. The stadium itself
has no such mandate, and other groups using the stadium have no such mandate eg Little Athletics, it's
just Athletics SA events.

It remains an unprecedented and unforgivable madness of our time that no cost-benefit analysis was
ever done on any covid policies employed over the past 2 years, and the world, especially our children,
have suffered, and will be suffering the consequences for generations to come. It has been clearly
established for some time now by both scientific evidence and real world data that policies such as
masks make no difference at all when it comes to transmission, and on the contrary in fact do great
harm to children in particular, in diverse and incredibly important
social/mental/developmental/psychological/health ways. This is exactly why so many countries around
the world are unwinding/cancelling/reversing so many damaging covid policies like lockdown, masks
and "vaccination" mandates, and unfortunately Australia remains behind the scientific/data/evidentiary
curve.
