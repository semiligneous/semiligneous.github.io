Submission to the COVID-19 Response

My submission comes from my own personal experience personally and professionally as a
result of the COVID-19 Response in NSW.

ISSUE

   •     Issue 1: Treatment of^^^^B by the NSW Health system who suffered a severe
         reaction to his second Pfizer vaccine.

   •     Issue 2: Career of a 30+ year Public Servant dedicated in the role
                   protecting the community ended abruptly.

BACKGROUND

  Issue 1:
My^^^^Hworks in the fitness industry, he suffered                        post his second Pfizer
'vaccine' Dec 2021                    ■ He has since been admitted again to
hospital experiencing^^^^^^^^^^^ The Cardiologist released             without a
conclusive diagnosis stating "Myocarditis" to "STEMII - ST elevation myocardial infarction"
(Attachment A - note "Document Has Been Revised" and note all medical staff were
"Interns" within his care). His release forms were changed when we inquired about an
adverse reaction to the vaccine. The discharge notes were changed from "acute
myocarditis".

He was then discharged from the hospital within hours of an^^^^^H Anecdotal
evidence: attending Nurse told my^^^^|not to ask about adverse reactions to the
vaccine as he would be discharged immediately.

The Cardiologist, Dr            then made any follow up appointments difficult. Would
not commit to any diagnosis and when pressed said we would have to "go
and pay for an^Band it would be very expensive".^^^^^^Bsaid there were no^|
                          within

On the                        my          underwent
                                      at our own expense

The rest is history with           he has been unhelpful, and his duty of care was
appalling, no follow up appointments could be made with his practice.

Department of Health announced Medicare Benefit Scheme (MBS) item 63399, "MRI to
assist in the diagnosing of myocarditis that may occur after vaccination with the mRNA
COVID-19 vaccines" (Australian Government Department of health MBS Fact Sheet 16
December 2021) could be claimed between periods 1 January 2022 - 30 June 2022).

We made a submission (Claim reference:^^^^^^^^^H. To this date we have not been
reimbursed. Medicare tell us we need to have myocarditis confirmed by a medical
practitioner (Cardiologist) confirming the claimable condition (Attachment B - Medicare
Response Letter).

The MBS item 63399 is:
                  to assist in diagnosing myocarditis that may occur..."

Yet we can't be paid out because we can't provide what Medicare state is holding up the
claim, that being:

"Provide a report from a cardiologist confirming the diagnosis of the vaccine related harm
you suffered."

This would requirea) speak with us and b) state that my^^^^^was harmed
by the vaccine when the cardiologist can't even confirm, nor his INTERNS, that it was
myocarditis.

Medicare have written and called asking why we haven't completed the submission. The
reasons we state is because ^^^^^^Iwon't confirm the "vaccine related harm". I ask -
how many Doctors have gone out on a limb and confirmed such statements.

My          had a second episode recently, while in the Emergency Department we
requested not to see^^^^^^l unfortunately he was attending. Two Doctors on night
duties when checkingwhile reading the notes history, read out loud previous
episode in 2021 was "myocarditis".

The last conversation with Medicare was a very nice person, she offered help and asked us
to report              obviously this is not an isolated incident. That we should visit another
cardiologist who is more 'sympathetic' (I say 'braver') to tell the truth and get the letter.
Medicare stated all we need is that one letter and we will be reimbursed. We were also told
that there was a list of doctors being reported for holding back on such letters, that
Medicare was 'investigating'.

I don't need to show you the stats around adverse reactions or provide reports and
references. It is in plain sight and readily available.

        Issue 2:
I have been 30+ years public servant with the NSW Government in the
        Reached              managing multiple District offices and volunteers that respond
to                      I hold the                              and the                 and
have commendations from State Ministers.

Terminated January 2022 for "misconduct" as a result of not following orders to vaccinate.
Terminated within eight weeks of notification. As a result, joined the
following complaints process (Industrial Relations Commissions, Fair Work Commission).

I did not get vaccinated due to               experience listed in Issue 1; after all, we had to
have one parent fit and alive to protect and provide for our
CURRENT POSITION

Issue 1: My          suffered some mental trauma because of                     actions (lack of
action) and the financial strain the medical bills has created.

Issue 2: Currently waiting on the Human Rights Commission response to submission.

RECOMMENDATIONS

    •   Those with Medicare claims against item 63399 are re-opened and reassessed by a
        neutral doctor.
    •   That cardiologists such as^^^^^H are reported/investigated by Australian Health

        Practitioner Regulation Agency (Aphra).


    •      Clear Personal Files with "Misconduct" listed as reason for exiting the Department.
    •      Reinstate those Public Servants terminated for refusal to vaccinate.

CONCLUSION

All I want is fair justice and to be able to finish my career on a high note. To continue the
good work I have carried out for the past 30+ years. I have consistently put my life in danger
to protect the community working for the NSW Government. This will in turn reduce the
stress, anxiety and pressure my                to this day, still experiences as a consequence of
lack of duty of care, poor mechanics of government and financial strain.
