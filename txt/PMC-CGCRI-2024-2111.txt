                   Covid 19 Response Inquiry Submission

I am one of many individuals in Australia who believe that some of the
restrictions imposed by the State and Territory Governments were
inconsistent, irrational and the cause of much trauma. The measures taken by
some State Governments particularly in relation to border closures were
extremely damaging emotionally, physically and financially to many
Australians.

Along with many other Australians I live in one State and have family in other
States. In my case my^^^^^Hand                           in the ACT and my
^^^^^^^Hand                            lived in Queensland. I was required to
quarantine in a hotel for two weeks on two occasions to visit my^^Jbefore
she passed away. On another occasion I was trapped in the ACT when it went
into lock down and was denied entry to Victoria where I lived with my^^^^^
We were separated for three months because just as the Victorian border
finally opened up, my^^^Hhealth had deteriorated and I had to apply to be
allowed into Queensland. The fact that I was vaccinated and tested negative
didn't make any difference to the Victorian or Queensland Governments.
When I was prevented from leaving the ACT to go home to Victoria the
number of Covid cases per head of population was less in the ACT than in
Victoria but that didn't seem to be considered either.

Given that it is highly likely with growing population we will experience
another pandemic, I believe it is crucial that the Federal Government
determine which actions by the States were effective and which actions caused
unnecessary trauma for many Australians and impose a consistent approach in
the future.
