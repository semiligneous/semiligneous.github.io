COVID-19 Response Inquiry

My submission for the Prime Minister and Cabinet in relation to the COVID-19 Response
Inquiry is that this measure is not sufficient to fully address the issues and deficiencies of the
Australian Government’s actions during this event.

I demand a proper Royal Commission to undertake a full and frank investigation into the
COVID-19 response. The Royal Commission should investigate and address:

- Deliberate misinformation and messaging from the government and bombardment of the
public with “fear pom” rather than actual facts
Examples:
(a) the safety & efficacy of experimental “vaccines”;
(b) actual risk to the population from the “virus”;
(c) alternate treatment options
(d) vaccine injuries

- Censorship of information or scientific evidence opposing the “official agenda” leading to
biased messaging and stifling of open debate and full and informed decision making
Examples:
(a) silencing of doctors
(b) the role of APHRA and ATAGI in censorship
(c) interference with the doctor/patient relationship and the right of full and informed consent

- Gross overreach of powers; actions taken without proper scientific evidence or cause and in
contravention to the human rights of the people of Australia
Examples:
(a) unlawful mandates and lockdowns
(b) unlawful fines and restrictions
(c) corrupt vaccine procurement and secret deals
(d) monetary incentives to push an untested and unnecessary medical treatment on the
Australian people

- Negative impacts to the Australian people from actions taken by the Australian Government
Examples:
(a) economic impacts (loss of jobs, national debt, inappropriate use of funds of the Australian
people)
(b) mental health impacts
(c) increases in excess mortality rates as a result of mandates, lockdowns, unproven medical
interventions
