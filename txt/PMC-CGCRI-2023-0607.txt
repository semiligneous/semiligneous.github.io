1) How can the government be taken seriously when it has only given the plebs one weeks' notice to
   prepare and submit submissions?
2) Why do the terms of reference of this "enquiry" exclude all state actions - including vaccine
   mandates, state border closures, lockdowns, quarantine, and check-in rules? As Australians, we are
   entitled to know about these items, yet the Australian government treats its citizens with utter
   contempt by withholding information such as this. This clearly proves that the government does not
   care what we think.
3) The Australian federal government purchased approximately 255 million covid vaccine doses,
   however, as Australia's population is slightly more than 26 million, this equates to 10 jabs for every
   Australian - the maximum dosage prescribed in Australia is five. Why does it appear to be normal
   practice for the government to waste our money?
4) Why did the Victorian government health department delete data from its website data that showed
   the number of deaths in previous years that were caused by influenza were almost identical to those
   "caused" by covid shortly after it emerged?
5) How can it possibly be conceived as "fair" when governments forced employers to waste their time
   and money to maintain a record of employee vaccinations etc, then at a later period to again force
   employers to destroy these records, despite regulations stating that they were only intended to
   operate for 12 months?
