  1.    Introduction
Australia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic is internationally and domestically considered to be
strong, largely well-coordinated and having saved lives.
The Australian Government’s (the Government) immediate response to stopping transmission of the
virus was focused on active and early suppression. The strategy featured restrictions on
international travel, domestic test and trace and quarantine interventions. Decisions were made
quickly, and COVID-19 response measures were implemented rapidly to manage what was a fast
moving and uncertain health crisis.
The initial response was multi-faceted. It focused on ensuring access to essential health services for
its citizens both in Australia and the eventual repatriation for citizens who were overseas. The initial
response also involved the planning and establishment of infrastructure to manage the increased
pressure the health system was likely to face. The response was continually updated to remain fit
for purpose based on emerging global evidence.
The response shifted when the pandemic evolved and vaccines became available, ensuring
widespread vaccination whilst monitoring health system capacity to manage outbreaks and
protecting those most at risk.
Australia’s health response was supported by an integrated suite of social, economic and education
programs such as Jobkeeper, JobSeeker, Pandemic Leave Disaster payments and supports to
facilitate remote learning. These programs contributed significantly to the health response’s
success.
In addition to the Government response to COVID-19, Commonwealth-State relations became
crucial, with the National Cabinet playing a key role in coordination efforts. The pandemic required
unprecedented collaboration between jurisdictions and the Commonwealth to ensure health
services across the country were able to be mobilised during the pandemic.
A key priority for the Government and the Department of Health and Aged Care (the Department) is
to ensure that Australia can respond to any future pandemics. There have been many learnings
throughout COVID-19 that have led to new policies and programs of work that increase Australia’s
preparedness for any future pandemics. Many of these are already underway in the Department
and across Government.
The Government has established the interim Australian Centre for Disease Control (CDC) to
continue to prepare for public health emergencies through:
   •       multi-jurisdictional training exercises,
   •       improving the national public health surveillance system, and
   •       building capability in One Health and health security.
The Australian CDC will further leverage the lessons from COVID-19 and be fundamental to
Australia’s capacity to deal with future pandemics. It will boost national communication, co­
ordination, and collaboration across jurisdictions, as well as build emergency response capacity,
strengthen prevention, detection and monitoring of communicable disease.
The nexus between public health, social and economic system capabilities will be key for the
Australian CDC. Future pandemic response mechanisms must again be seen as broader than a
health response. Further consideration is needed on what capabilities are developed, including
onshore and sovereign manufacturing, and emergency response provision of key health and aged
care supports.
Nevertheless, to ensure we are well positioned for any future pandemic it has been important to
examine both what went well and look for opportunities for improvement.

         1        .1.     Submission scope
This submission addresses Terms of Reference relevant to the Department. It provides a holistic
view of Australia’s health response through the input of the Department portfolio agencies, advisory
groups, and committees.The Department’s health response during COVID-19.


    2.    The Department’s health response during COVID-19

    Relevant Term(s) of Reference: Governance including the role of the Commonwealth
    Government, responsibilities of state and territory governments, national governance
    mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination Mechanism and the
    Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory bodies supporting
    responses to COVID-19.

This section will include:
•     2.1 - The Department’s COVID-19 response
•     2.2 - Portfolio agencies
•     2.3 - Other relevant agencies
•     2.4 - Expert bodies/advisory groups and committees
•     2.5 - Commonwealth/State relationship
•     2.6 - Key response outcomes
         2.1.           The Department
Australia has a well-established and strong health protection framework. COVID-19 tested every
aspect of this framework. Professor Brendan Murphy AC, then Chief Medical Officer (CMO),
declared COVID-19 a ‘Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance’ (COINS) on
18 February 2020. This was almost a month ahead of the World Health Organization (WHO)
declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. This COINS declaration lasted 1,340 days, ending on 20 October
2023, making it the longest health emergency in Australia’s history.
The size, scale and length of the pandemic was unlike anything the Department had dealt with. The
Department embraced two roles in response. The first was the primary national coordination point
and advisory body for the health response. The second involved implementing measures to bolster
the capacity of the health and aged care sectors to respond to the pandemic. The Department
worked with Government to rapidly secure additional funding for the health and aged care response,
ensuring measures were proportionate and scalable. This saw the Department take on new and
expanded responsibilities including sourcing and distributing personal protective equipment (PPE),
COVID-19 tests and treatments, and managing the National COVID-19 Vaccine Program.
The National Incident Centre (NIC) (formerly the National Incident Room) in the Office of Health
Protection and Response (OHPR) led the Department’s early response in the pandemic. The NIC
was staffed by expert medical advisers, epidemiologists, pandemic policy, communications, public
health and logistics specialists. OHPR acted as the National Focal Point (NFP) for Australia, fulfilling
our obligations under the WHO International Health Regulations (IHRs) as the conduit between all
levels of government and our international partners.
The Department then repositioned as the response expanded, mobilising staff from across the
organisation to areas of priority and pausing all non-critical work. In the early stages of the
pandemic in 2020 movements and secondments from across Australian Public Service (APS)
supplemented the Department’s workforce. Recruitment in the Department accelerated by mid-
2020. An additional 776 ongoing and non-ongoing employees were recruited in that year. In 2021, a
further 1,688 employees were employed to primarily support the Aged Care Group and the COVID-


                                                                                                      4
19 Vaccine Taskforce. This represented an 18% and 32% increase in headcount across these two
years.
The Outbreak Response and Aged Care COVID-19 Vaccine branches in the Aged Care Service
Delivery Division are examples of new branches established to manage the threats to vulnerable
population groups. The Department’s role in supporting residential aged care homes (RACHs)
required a workforce available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week across Australia. At its peak in March
2022, the Department had a surge workforce of 1,006 people.
       2.2.            Portfolio Agencies and Statutory Office Holders
The Health and Aged Care portfolio has 20 agencies, eight statutory office holders and five
regulators. These authorities work alongside the Department to collectively deliver the
Government’s health policies and programs. The roles of the Agencies were varied and
strengthened Government’s ability to respond quickly and appropriately to the multitude of
challenges that were faced each day of the pandemic.
For example, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (ACQSC), the national regulator of
aged care services, played a central role in protecting the lives of older Australians in RACHs.
ACQSC did this by providing COVID-19 related resources. This included information for providers,
monitoring services and compliance with infection control arrangements. In addition, ACQSC
developed clinical advice on vaccination and the appropriate use of antiviral medications specific for
aged care settings. ACQSC also provided targeted education and monitoring to support higher risk
residential services during outbreaks.
The Australian Digital Health Agency, in partnership with the Department, accelerated the adoption
of digital products and information services including electronic prescriptions. Australia achieved
significant growth in consumers and clinicians viewing test results and vaccination information in the
My Health Record application and website.
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) leveraged existing State and Territory
relationships to:
   •          monitor, report and provide advice in ‘real time’ on the impact of outbreaks,
   •          restrictions on health system capacity, and
   •          mental health service use.
The National Blood Authority assisted through developing rapid access to blood products to treat
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, when this emerged as a rare side effect of COVID-19
vaccination. This reduced the incidence of death and severe morbidity.
Other portfolio agencies adjusted their role to add value to the Australian health response. For
example, the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme worked with the sector to pivot
their role. This allowed distillers who would normally only produce alcohol products for consumption
to redirect their efforts into formulating these alcohol products for non-therapeutic hand sanitisers.
More information on the Health Portfolio response is available in Attachment 1.
       2.3.            Other relevant agencies
 It was important for the Department to formally and informally partner with other Government and
jurisdictional agencies. This ensured the COVID-19 health response aligned with the broader
COVID-19 response.
In early 2020 the Department provided advice to numerous agencies and sectors to support them to
respond to the pandemic. As well as across the APS, this included advice related to airlines,
supermarkets and other essential retailers, schools and universities, and public transport services.
The Government and the Victorian Government established the Victoria Aged Care Response
Centre (VACRC) later in 2020 to support the outbreaks in RACHs in Victoria, The VACRC, in
collaboration with the Australian Medical Assistance Team (AUSMAT), brought together agencies,


                                                                                                     5
experts and stakeholders in a coordinated effort to create a safe environment for residents. This
collaborative model was adopted in similar forms in other States and Territories.
The Department also received significant support from other Government departments. For
example, formal partnerships were established with the Department of Defence (Defence), to
execute Operation COVID Shield. The Department worked closely with the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to assist with COVID-19 vaccine international donations. The Australian
Defence Force (ADF) supported the aged care response providing on the ground support for the
VACRC and RACHs in other aged care outbreaks across Australia. The Department worked with
the National Indigenous Australians Agency and relevant State and Territory agencies to prepare for
and respond to outbreaks in First Nations communities.
The Department hosted Department Liaison Officers from the Australian Border Force (ABF), ADF,
the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), DFAT and the Department of the
Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C).
The Department continues to work with the Department of Social Services (DSS), the National
Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) regarding the
impact of COVID-19 on people with disability.
This collaboration was central to the success of the Government’s national COVID-19 vaccine
rollout in reaching many diverse and vulnerable population groups. In addition. It helped identify
where uptake in particular geographic areas lagged behind the broader population.
Critical to these arrangements is clarity of purpose, an understanding of the capabilities required to
support the response and clear lines of accountability.
      2.4.           Expert bodies/advisory groups and committees
On 29 May 2020, the then Prime Minister announced a new Commonwealth/State governance
architecture with National Cabinet at the centre. The Council of Governments (COAG) and
associated structures, including COAG Health Council, were replaced with the exception of the
continuation of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC).

Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC)
Following the establishment of the new National Cabinet, the AHPPC reported directly to National
Cabinet for most of the COVID-19 pandemic. It no longer reported through the Australian Health
Ministers Advisory Committee or Health Ministers. It met over 580 times. The committee played a
vital role in supporting national cohesion, particularly early in the pandemic. While there were
occasional differences among jurisdictions, the collaboration was genuine and consistent.
The reorientation of the AHPPC away from reporting through Health Chief Executives and Health
Ministers, meant the AHPPC was sometimes the sole adviser on health matters to National Cabinet
and the primary Commonwealth/State coordination body. This change in scope for the AHPPC
required the committee to meet up to three times per day. It also resulted in COVID issues
sometimes being considered in isolation from broader health system issues. There was no formal
governance arrangement involving Health Ministers in relation to the COVID health response.
Health CEOs and Health Ministers informally came together to progress priority issues.

Other key committees
The Department leant on many of the existing expert committees and created new ones to ensure
policy and program advice for COVID -19 responses were driven by expertise. In total more than 80
committees were formally or informally used to guide the Department’s COVID-19 response.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), established in 1997 to provide
advice in relation to immunisation policies and procedures, became the publicly trusted source of
evidence-based advice on COVID-19 vaccinations. Other groups such as the AHPPC Aged Care
Advisory Group, APPHC National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Protection, COVID-19

                                                                                                         6
Disability Advisory Committee and COVID-19 Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) Advisory
Committee were newly established to progress COVID-19 issues and have become enduring
features of the Department’s consultation and engagement approach.
A detailed list of many of the committees and advisory groups that supported the COVID-19
pandemic response is at Attachment 2.

 Key Learnings
 Clarity of leadership, roles and clear governance structures are critical to support effective
 emergency responses. This clarity is essential given the pace at which governance and advisory
 committees work during health emergencies. In establishing the Australian CDC, it will be
 important to ensure appropriate and clear governance mechanisms are in place to support
 independent advice, across all emergencies, including health emergencies.
 Governance mechanisms need to adopt a whole of government focus to ensure a ‘person
 centred’ approach to pandemic planning and response. This supports an integrated response,
 while protecting vulnerable cohorts. This will be a central consideration in the establishment of the
 final Australian CDC.

     2.5.                     Commonwealth/State relationship
Australia has a world class health care system based on universal access to quality services.
Responsibility for the health system is shared between the Commonwealth and State and Territory
Governments as shown in Table 1.

   The Australian, state and territory, and local governments share responsibility for running our health system.

Commonwealth responsibilities include setting national policies, contributing funding for public
hospital services, and funding and regulating the aged care system. It also involves managing the
Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and other
targeted health funding programs. State and territory governments manage and fund a large
proportion of the health care system, including managing public hospitals and service delivery,
including public community-based health care services.
Under the Australian Constitution, State and Territory Governments have primary responsibility for
public health, including surveillance and response for human health. States and Territories have
                                                                                                                                     7
legislative powers enabling them to implement biosecurity arrangements within their borders that
complement Commonwealth biosecurity arrangements as well as a broad range of other legislated
public health and emergency response powers.
Commonwealth-state relations for the management of public health and emergency responses were
transformed during COVID-19, with the National Cabinet playing a pivotal role in coordinating the
response to both the health and economic crisis.
The pandemic required the Australian and State and Territory Governments to work together more
closely than ever before to ensure the health system was able to respond to the pandemic. The
National Partnership on COVID-19 Response (COVID-19 Partnership) was central to this
collaboration.

The National Partnership on COVID-19 Response
The COVID-19 Partnership commenced in March 2020 and ceased on 31 December 2022. The
COVID-19 Partnership provided States and Territories with immediate financial assistance for
additional costs incurred by state health systems in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
COVID-19 Partnership was the biggest health response measure, accounting for almost a quarter of
COVID-19 Commonwealth health spending ($14.26b).
Under the COVID-19 Partnership, the Commonwealth paid 50% of costs incurred by States and
Territories to diagnose, treat and manage COVID-19 in public hospital settings. The COVID-19
Partnership also covered 100 % of costs associated with aged care prevention, preparedness, and
response activities. This was in recognition that responsibility for aged care is primarily a
Commonwealth responsibility. Under usual public hospital arrangements, as defined by the National
Health Reform Agreement (NHRA), the Commonwealth contributes 45% of the efficient growth of
services.
These arrangements provided flexible Commonwealth support that allowed States and Territories to
adopt local responses that changed over time. Key measures funded under this agreement included
mass vaccination and testing clinics operated by the States and Territories and the private hospital
viability guarantee program. The below table outlines what the COVID-19 Partnership funded,
including how the Commonwealth funded new activities or bolstered Commonwealth/State public
health, hospital and aged care funding.

The COVID-19 Partnership leveraged existing public hospital funding governance and financial
arrangements. This included using the Administrator of the National Health Funding Pool, as well as
National Health Funding Body (NHFB) and the Independent Health and Aged Care Pricing Authority
(IHACPA), to estimate, reconcile and ensure transparency and accountability for this investment.
This complemented the other most significant Commonwealth/State health funding arrangement,
the NHRA, and allowed public hospital funding to increase. The COVID-19 Partnership did not
impact the NHRA’s long term spending as it was not structurally included into ongoing payments to
States and Territories.
The detail of the COVID-19 Partnership was varied through the pandemic emergency response to
ensure it supported the health response as it evolved. This included the agreement of dedicated
schedules for vaccine delivery funding and residential aged care support.
In January 2023, the COVID-19 Partnership was replaced by the National Partnership for Priority
Groups COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination (PGTV) as the emergency phase of the COVID-19
pandemic subsided. The Commonwealth contributed 50% of the costs associated with COVID-19
testing and vaccine dose delivery through the PGTV. These were considered the two most
significant measures from the previous COVID-19 Partnership. The PGTV focused on priority
population groups who were most at risk of severe COVID-19 infection or death. The PGTV expired
on 31 December 2023.

 Key learnings
 The COVID Partnership was highly successful in providing necessary additional funding to States
 and Territories for public health activities however it resulted in the Commonwealth funding
 activities which were not traditionally funded by the Commonwealth. Consideration should be
 given to how to best provide funding for jurisdictions in a future public health emergency and
 enabling greater transparency in the public health funding component of the NHRA to ensure
 public health units across Australia are able to respond to future pandemics.
 The additional expenditure that States and Territories quickly invested in the pandemic to lift their
 public health capacity suggests insufficient pre-existing capability and capacity. The new_______

 Australian CDC may need to monitor capacity across all part of the system to ensure appropriate
 levels of preparedness.

       2.6.                Key response outcomes
In November 2023, the AIHW published Health system spending on the response to COVID-19 in
Australia 2019-20 to 2021-22'. This report found Australia ranked seventh lowest out of 36
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in terms of additional
health spending. Despite this, however, it found that Australia had the fifth lowest excess mortality
during 2020 to 2022.

COVID-19 Mortality
The Department took many effective steps to safeguard and protect Australian lives but, tragically,
the effects of COVID-19 were felt.
In 2020, Australia recorded approximately 35 COVID-19 deaths per million of the population. In
terms of international comparators, the United States had 1,041 deaths per million and the United
Kingdom had 1,382 per million.
Excess mortality is typically defined as the difference between the observed number of deaths and
the expected number of deaths in a specified period and can be used to quantify changes in
patterns of expected mortality.
Australia’s comparatively low COVID-19 associated excess mortality rate reflects the effectiveness
of public health measures and the resilience of the healthcare system. Continued vigilance,
vaccination efforts, effective communication strategies and adherence to preventative health
measures remained crucial as Australia navigated the pandemic. In addition, other factors such as
influenza cases were also down in 2020, indicating public health and social measures had an
impact on all circulating respiratory viruses in the community, not just COVID-19.
During 2020, Australia recorded lower than expected total mortality rates (excluding coroner-
certified deaths) compared with age-standardised mortality rates for the previous five years. This
may be the result of Australia’s public health response limiting the general spread of disease during
this period. This contrasts with other countries where excess mortality was observed in 2020 due to
the impact of COVID-19.
In December 2023, the ABS released updated official excess mortality estimates, detailing the
number of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023). This report compared to the number
of deaths expected based on historical trends and adjusted for population changes. This report
examined mortality due to all causes and found that COVID-19 was the main contributor to the
recorded excess mortality from 2021 to 2023. Mortality experienced 11.7% higher than expected
levels in 2022, however for the first eight months of 2023 reduced to 6.1%, meaning a move closer
to expected levels.
Some RACHs experienced significant outbreaks of COVID-19 early in the pandemicthat included
large numbers of resident deaths. International evidence confirmed this was not unique to Australia,
given the high risk setting of communal living conditions compounded with an already more
vulnerable population. However, emerging evidence suggests there was not a substantial increase
in the overall burden of disease for those in RACHs when compared to pre-pandemic fatal burden,
due to the suppression of non-COVID related illnesses (such as influenza). Although COVID-19
cases numbers increased substantially in the community and RACHs in the later years of the
pandemic, COVID-19 survival rates also increased. This was likely due to decreasing disease
severity with new virus strains, high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and the increased use of antiviral
treatments. In addition, the Government’s response to the Royal Commission into Aged Care

                                                                                                                                 10
Quality and Safety recognised the aged care sector as having been underfunded for decades and
has taken strong action to address this.
To understand vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 and all-cause mortality, in October 2022 the
department commissioned research from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and
Surveillance (NCIRS). The study focused on approximately 3.8 million people aged 65 years and
over - almost the entire Australian population in that age group, including those in RACHs. It found
that, in the first half of 2022, COVID-19 vaccination and boosters were effective in protecting against
death from COVID-192 by up to 93% compared to those who were unvaccinated. While vaccine
effectiveness wanes over time, the effectiveness of boosters remained above 50% six months after
receipt.

        3.1.                National Medical Stockpile
Established in 2002, the National Medical Stockpile (NMS) is Australia’s strategic reserve of
supplies for national health emergencies. It includes PPE, drugs and vaccines. Supplementary
stocks of these goods are held by State and Territory health authorities. Prior to the pandemic, the
NMS typically made up to 10 deployments a year, mostly to State and Territory Governments for
short periods of time (e.g. one-off deployments of antivenom in response to a single event).
The NMS’s role expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional supplies of PPE, ventilators,
primers, probes and reagents for COVID-19 testing, test kit components, and sample collection
swabs were required. The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the role of the NMS from short­
term surge capacity to a large-scale, long-term, multi-product support for a significant proportion of
the population.
From the start of the pandemic the NMS made more than 260,000 deployments containing
700 million units of PPE and other supplies. Deployment went to residential aged care providers,
Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs), Government agencies, State
and Territory Governments, National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) providers, the Royal
Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) and public hospitals. Further deployments were made via Primary

Health Networks (PHNs) and the Living with COVID-19 program to GPs, GP-led Respiratory Clinics
(GPRC) and pharmacies. This supported Australians to receive face-to-face health care including
for COVID-19 vaccination and treatments.
The Department had to manage extreme supply chain disruptions and unprecedented global
demand and competition from other countries throughout 2020 and 2021. The Government and
Department took measures to ensure preparedness, including:
•   undertaking ‘worst case’ scenario modelling, particularly for procuring ventilators for hospitals,
•   conducting substantial market intelligence research into global demand and supply chain
    volatility to ensure adequate procurement of essential PPE and other equipment (such as
    ventilators),
•   ensuring adequate supply and low wastage of PPE as a percentage of total procurement
    despite the challenges of unreliable supply chains in Australia and overseas, and
•   effective pre-deployment of standard packs of PPE to RACHs ahead of subsequent waves of
    COVID-19.
This allowed the Department to manage stakeholder expectations and streamline the management
of deployments, while ensuring provision of adequate supplies required by each jurisdiction.
The Department, through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) ensured the stockpile met
appropriate PPE standards, including undertaking laboratory testing to validate safety and
performance, the Department used the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs) to facilitate
commerce with legitimate sellers while safeguarding against potential scammers.
States and Territories initially continued to purchase their own PPE and other supplies. However,
the national approach to the NMS soon reduced jurisdictions and Government duplication of effort
and supported stabilising demand through a deflationary effect on PPE price. It strengthened
Australia’s ability to secure an adequate supply of PPE and other equipment, while also ensuring
jurisdictions had access to supply as needed.
Data and stock management are core requirements in health emergency management, particularly
when the NMS is drawn upon for extended periods. For the Department, the significant and
sustained procurement of PPE necessitated an interim solution to support the financial accounting
for NMS COVID-19 products. By mid-2020 the Department had deployed the Finance Inventory
Management Solution system which initially supported year-end reporting for FY 2019-20. This was
progressively enhanced over the following year to become the core inventory management system
for the NMS. From October 2021, the Department commenced use of a more advanced system,
Microsoft Dynamics, which enhanced the NMS’ inventory management capability.
The Department supported DFAT in their international regional health security efforts. This included
deploying a range of NMS supplies as humanitarian aid to countries in our region affected by
COVID-19 including Indonesia, India, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vietnam, Tonga and the Republic of
the Marshall Islands.
Following the release of the National COVID-19 Health Management Plan in late 2022, the NMS
continued to provide a safety net for essential equipment and treatments. The NMS is an enduring
capability that will continue to play a strategic role in responding to future health emergencies.




                                                                                                         12
 Key Learnings
 The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have helped the Department identify areas of
 improvement in the management of the NMS. These learnings have been supported by internal
 and external reviews, including by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO).
 Australia must have access to adequate and reliable supply channels for PPE and other critical
 equipment in a pandemic or other health emergency. This may include considering Australia’s
 sovereign capabilities to produce those goods.
 NMS procurements were largely successful during the pandemic. However, a stronger
 preparedness and established emergency procurement process will further support the
 Government’s ability to respond quickly with PPE and other NMS supply3. There has been
 significant progress on this within the Department. The Department has secured sovereign supply
 and the preparation of procurement arrangements for the supply of PPE and associated medical
 supplies.
 Preparedness is not limited only to COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. The Department is
 also considering how to ensure the NMS is prepared for other emergencies.
 A successful NMS requires clear understanding of roles and responsibilities, particularly when
 considering large scale coordination, procurement and deployment activities. Eliminating
 duplication of effort and having pre-agreed stockpiling governance in place with all jurisdictions
 will support effective outcomes in a future health emergency. In addition, transparency and
 availability of inventory between the Commonwealth and jurisdictions is critical to mitigate risk and
 ensure available product is supplied where most needed.
 The Department has commenced work with all jurisdictions to strengthen the NMS as an enduring
 capability, able to respond to any future pandemics and other health emergencies.

       3.2.                COVID-19 testing and pathology
Australia has an extensive network of public and private laboratories. Through this network, the
pathology sector was able to progressively upscale testing capacity as caseloads increased.
Testing was fundamental to Australia’s COVID-19 suppression strategy and integral to the Test,
Trace, Isolate and Quarantine (TTIQ) principles to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Testing enabled case surveillance and genomic sequencing, assisting health authorities to better
understand COVID-19 and any variants of concern. The National Pathology Accreditation Program
supported the nationwide delivery of high-quality testing.
The aim of the Government was to provide all people in Australia with free access to adequate and
appropriate COVID-19 testing, irrespective of Medicare status.
The Department’s testing response was strengthened by financial support for public and private
sector testing capacity, increased investment in testing technology and supplies, and the creation of
new temporary MBS items for pathology testing. Shared funding with State and Territory
Governments for COVID-19 testing4 was also provided under the COVID-19 Partnership.
Australia’s technical advice on COVID-19 testing5 was provided by members of the Public Health
Laboratory Network (PHLN), a sub-committee of AHPPC. This expert network published 11

guidance statements over the course of the pandemic. This ensured that as new evidence became
available, best practice testing methodologies and techniques were communicated.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs)
PCR testing played a critical role in identifying COVID-19 cases particularly prior to RATs becoming
readily available to the public. In partnership with State and Territory Governments, mass PCR
testing clinics were established. PCR testing was essential when access to more sensitive testing
was required. Australians were, and still are where applicable, able to access bulk-billed COVID-19
tests under the temporary MBS items developed for COVID-19 pathology.
 In January 2022, RATs were embedded as a diagnostic test in Australia’s testing regime following a
joint statement by the PHLN and the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA), and
support by the AHPPC. The TGA assessed over 100 RAT kits to ensure safe and effective kits
were available to Australians.
The Government, in partnership with States and Territories, provided free testing clinics with access
to PCR testing and free RATs for those who needed them under public health orders.
Up to 31 December 2023 the Government has funded:
•    77.9 million COVID-19 PCR tests:
          o    39.6 million MBS funded COVID-19 PCR tests, and
          o    Around 43 million COVID-19 PCR tests under the COVID-19 Partnership
•    Around 169 million COVID-19 RATs distributed to eligible sectors from the NMS.

COVID-19 testing for those most at risk of severe disease
The Government maintained a commitment to ensuring those most at risk of severe disease or
illness had access to COVID-19 testing. The Department developed targeted PCR testing programs
for vulnerable groups, including:
•    Prioritised PCR testing for RACHs,
•    Point of care testing for remote First Nations communities, and
•    In-reach testing services to support those unable to attend a testing facility, as well as in RACHs
     or supported independent living disability settings (SIL) where outbreaks were a higher risk.
Further, RATs were directly provided to RACHs, ACCHOs, GPRCs, SIL disability care and RFDS to
enable additional and easy access to screening in those settings.
The COVID-19 Remote Point of Care Testing
The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) and the Department
identified early the need early to take action to reduce transmission and the possible outbreak of
COVID-19 in First Nations communities. The COVID-19 Remote Point of Care Testing (POCT)
program and use of RATs managed the detection of COVID-19 in First Nations communities. The
POCT program was and remains highly successful. An independent review of the POCT program
estimated that the Program prevented up to 122,000 infections and avoided between $337 million
and $1.8 billion in healthcare costs6.

The Government engaged Sonic Healthcare from April 2020 to April 2023 to provide PCR testing
services in RACHs that have active COVID-19 outbreaks. Over the life of the contract, over
2.8 million COVID-19 PCR pathology laboratory tests were provided at over 3,200 RACHs.
Once the program ended, the Department provided targeted communication to support aged care
residents access COVID-19 testing via Medicare.
Under the 2023 National COVID Health Management Plan, emergency in-reach COVID-19 PCR
pathology testing services for RACHs was still available on request from 1 May 2023 to
31 December 2023.

The COVID-19 Rapid Test Concessional Access (CRTCA) Program
From 24 January to 31 July 2022, the CRTCA Program provided eligible concession card holders
access to up to 20 COVID-19 rapid antigen tests at no cost. The program was established within
weeks of the revised PHLN/CDNA position recommending rapid antigen diagnostic testing be
incorporated into Australia’s testing regime. The Program was delivered by over 5,600 community
pharmacies and provided almost 70 million RATs. The funding was cost shared (50-50) with the
Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments.

Current COVID-19 testing strategy
In 2022, Australia expanded testing for COVID-19 to include other respiratory illnesses (influenza
and respiratory syncytial virus). This testing model increases efficiency by allowing prompt
identification and treatment for respiratory illnesses with similar symptoms to COVID-19. The
temporary COVID-19 MBS items were restructured to allow for this.
Since late 2022, COVID-19 tests are no longer primarily a surveillance tool, but a diagnostic
strategy to support access to antiviral treatments.

Genomic sequencing strategy
The Department relied on enhanced expertise to guide Australia’s national approach to COVID-19
genome sequencing to support the COVID-19 response. Over the course of the pandemic the
sequencing analysis was used to inform decision-making.

 Key Learnings
 The need for testing as a function of pandemic disease control, at the scale and capacity required
 during COVID-19, was unforeseen and unprecedented in Australia.
 Testing capacity
 The PHLN COVID-19 After Action Review’ noted the pressures on laboratory systems to maintain
 high daily testing rates. These challenges were exacerbated by overseas supply chain
 interruptions and limited capacity to produce critical reagents in Australia on a large scale. The
 report identified poor connectivity between different laboratory information systems that inhibited
 rapid information sharing. Limited access to an expanded trained workforce and inadequate
 surge support were other core challenges.
 The new Australian CDC needs to play a role to ensure these issues are considered when
 planning for future emergency responses.




                                                                                                     15
    Nationally consistent application of protocols and prioritisation
    There was significant variability of testing requirements between jurisdictions, including as a
    prerequisite to move between states. A nationally consistent protocol may reduce pressure on
    PCR testing resources and infrastructure, enabling the rapid assessment of high-priority and/or
    high-risk patients to be prioritised, especially during peak testing periods.
    Increasing availability and test result turnaround of PCR testing in rural and regional areas needs
    early consideration at a national level to ensure equity for rural and regional communities.
    Compliance considerations
    Nationally agreed testing protocols and parameters would support compliance with funding
    arrangements for COVID-19 tests. COVID-19 testing had two components:
    •    Diagnostic testing of symptomatic people following clinical review under the MBS, and
    •    mass population screening at state-run sites funded under the COVID-19 Partnership.
    State and Territory governments received advice from the Department that PCR tests conducted
    for screening should be billed through the COVID-19 Partnership and not the MBS. This is due to
    provisions in the Health Insurance Act 1973 which are aimed at ensuring MBS diagnostic services
    are referred by an appropriate clinician, and to reduce duplication in public funding for health
    services.
    Guidelines for testing set at a state level and local billing practices often conflicted with this
    advice. Some tests may not have met legislative requirements for a clinician to have reviewed a
    patient before requesting a test.
    Future responses to national heath emergencies would benefit from earlier strategic work
    between the Commonwealth and jurisdictions to identify, mitigate and monitor areas of potential
    non-compliance.

          3.3.           COVID-19 contact tracing
Contact tracing, or ‘Trace’, was essential to Australia’s COVID-19 suppression and contain the
spread strategies, playing an integral role connecting all the TTIQ principles. The value for contact
tracing pivoted, depending on low or high caseload environments across the pandemic. In the
suppression phase, effective contact tracing allowed for appropriate and precise quarantine and
isolation policy. During a high caseload environment, the identification of priority populations and
those most at risk of infection and/or severe disease, saw contact tracing shift to automated
processes. This included a focus on high-risk settings such as aged care and First Nation
communities.
A team of epidemiologists coordinated and funded by the Department and seconded to State and
Territory health departments, support the data strategy, quality, transmission, and analysis of
COVID-19 contact tracing and surveillance. This network of staff provided a link between
jurisdictional and national epidemiological and policy review.
COVIDSafe app
The COVIDSafe app was launched in April 2020 to assist State and Territory health officials with
manual contact tracing. From commencement to decommission on 16 August 2022:
•       around 7.9 million users registered on the app, and
•       792 users who had tested positive consented to upload their app data, resulting
        in 1.7 million handshakes and 2,829 potential close contacts.




                                                                                                         16
The intent of the app was to reduce manual contact tracing; however, it faced many challenges. A
2022 effectiveness evaluation7 of the app found that while it was well developed for consumer
usability, it was perceived as burdensome for public health staff who undertook contract tracing. The
app generated a large volume of data creating additional workloads. Public criticism of the app
included fears of government tracking personal information. Despite taking privacy considerations
seriously, management of this public perception could have been stronger to alleviate these
concerns.
Use of the app also declined over time as jurisdictions developed their own apps, including with
integrated QR code systems.

    Key Learnings
    There was variability of contract tracing among States and Territories which impacted the overall
    national COVID-19 approach.
    COVIDSafe App
    Future development and implementation of a similar COVIDSafe App would require a feasibility
    review and evaluation. While a national system in theory should be effective, data access,
    technical challenges, and cross jurisdictional overlap would need to be considered and assessed.

        3.4.                COVID-19 vaccination
The National COVID-19 Vaccination Program (the Program) was fundamental to Australia’s COVID-
19 response. The Program was the first population level national vaccination rollout in Australian
history, with the Government investing over $18 billion in vaccine and COVID-19 treatment supply.
The first COVID-19 vaccine was administered on 21 February 2021 and by 31 December 2021,
91.4% of people aged over 16 years in Australia were fully vaccinated. Approximately 78% of the
population were vaccinated in 264 days. Australia achieve one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination
rates in the world.
As of 17 January 2024, almost 70 million COVID-19 vaccinations have been administered.
The National COVID Vaccination Program
The Program was guided by Australia’s COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Strategy8 (the Strategy).
The Strategy was released in August 2020, and supported early access to, and delivery of, safe and
effective COVID-19 vaccines. It highlighted five areas of focus: research and development;
purchase and manufacturing; international partnerships; regulation and safety; immunisation
administration and monitoring.
This approach included centralising the purchasing, logistics and operations, as well as changes to
the administration of the vaccines. The need to take a different approach was driven by the need to
vaccinate the population quickly.
The Program received considerable Ministerial oversight. The then Prime Minister announced
Australia would achieve 4 million vaccinations by 31 March 2021. After several challenges, this
target was not met (600,000 were achieved). Some of the challenges included:
•     the schedule of vaccine deliveries could not be brought forward,
•     vaccine distribution challenges such as cold chain breaches (CCBs),

•   the recalibration of the program following ATAGI recommendation regarding the AstraZeneca
    vaccine,
•   more complex vaccine administration protocols for the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine that had the
    potential to increased vaccine administration errors,
•   complexities in providing vaccinations for priority populations,
•   insufficient cultural communication support for mobile, in reach vaccination clinics, and
•   difficulties gaining access to the data required to report on program performance.
Operation COVID Shield
In June 2021, Lieutenant General John Frewen was appointed to lead Operation COVID Shield
(OCS) to accelerate the vaccination rollout. OCS was a collaboration with ADF and existing
Departmental staff. The military led planning and assessment teams worked with the existing
taskforce to develop a Campaign Plan to meet the targets set out in the Government’s National Plan
to transition Australia’s National COVID-19 Response.9 This Campaign Plan was underpinned by
modelling undertaken by the Doherty Institute.
The rate of residential aged care workers receiving their first COVID-19 vaccine increased from
50% to 99.4% over a six-week period in 2021. Over the remainder of 2021, vaccine uptake
increased significantly, particularly for at-risk groups. By 31 December 2021 over 91.4% of eligible
people over 16 years in Australia had completed a primary course10, an increase of nearly 65%
since mid-August 202111.
In addition to the work of OCS, there are several potential reasons for the improved uptake
including the improved vaccine supplies.

Adverse events
Australia’s first case of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) was reported in April 2021
following an individual receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. As a result, on 8 April 2021, the
Government accepted ATAGI advice that the Pfizer vaccine be used in those under 50 years of age
given the increased risk of TTS in younger people. The vaccine program was recalibrated to bring
forward additional cohorts to make use of the available AstraZeneca vaccine.
Recalibration compounded program delays as most of the vaccine available in Australia at that time
was AstraZeneca while most of the Australian population now required the Pfizer vaccine. Fears of
adverse events from the AstraZeneca vaccine also increased vaccine hesitancy in the community.

Logistics
The vaccine rollout logistical operation required the capacity to act rapidly and flexibly to address
new waves and virus variants as they emerged. The Department had not required logistical
capability of this nature prior to the pandemic and built this capability over time.
Preparedness for future pandemics will need to consider how the Government builds and maintains
the capability to deliver end-to-end logistics and operations of this nature in an emergency. This
may include drawing on the expertise across the Commonwealth and the private sector.

Vaccine wastage
Global demand outweighed supply of vaccines in the early stages of the Program, and vaccine
wastage needed to be minimised. Challenges were faced due to vaccines arriving in multi-dose

vials which could not be stored once opened. Wastage rates were very low, at 0.72% in June 2021;
and 5.12% in December 2021.
Since mid-2022 demand for vaccination has fallen, resulting in Australia having an oversupply of
vaccines. The priority has shifted from minimising wastage to ensuring vaccines are readily
available. In January 2024 Australia’s wastage rate was 35.41%, remaining within the WHO
acceptable levels (15% to 40%) for multi dose vials.
The Department developed and implemented the COVID-19 Vaccine Administrative System
(CVAS) to reduce waste and manage stocks. The program included agile procedures to reallocate
excess stock to minimise wastage, working closely with manufacturers to align supply of vaccines,
and facilitate international donations.

Onshore mRNA manufacturing capability
In March 2022, the Government signed a strategic partnership with Moderna, strengthening
Australia’s capability to respond in the event of a future pandemic. This partnership establishes a
domestic mRNA vaccine manufacturing capacity and capability. Under the agreement, the
Government may purchase locally manufactured mRNA vaccines. Moderna will also have the
capacity to supply the Government with non-pandemic vaccines through a supply agreement.
Construction of the facility is underway, with mRNA respiratory vaccines expected to be available
from the Melbourne facility in approximately August 2025.
More information on COVID-19 vaccines is at Attachment 3.

 Key Learnings

 Program design
 Vaccination programs need to be capable of enabling vaccine delivery to scale up and down
 based on the phase of a pandemic and demand for the vaccine. For example, the Program took a
 whole of population level approach at the start of the pandemic and has now moved to a more
 targeted model. This is achieved by ensuring flexibility in approach across supply, distribution,
 and access models.
 It is also critical that vaccine programs have access to relevant data and intelligence. The
 supporting data and reporting system that was at the core of the Program’s end-to-end
 distribution model allowed vaccines to be directed to where they were needed.
 A portfolio approach to vaccine purchasing, across brands, technology and establishing a
 sovereign supply may also safeguard against the uncertainty of pandemic conditions. In an
 emergency phase of a pandemic consistent vaccine supply is critical to protect against severe
 disease or illness.
 Engaging a wide range of health professionals across the private and public sector supported
 Australia’s whole of population vaccination goal. Health professionals need to be supported by
 adeguate training and advice to enable safe vaccine administration.

 Supporting priority populations
 As the pandemic progressed not all measures were egually effective across all population
 groups. For example:
     -   Some culturally and linguistically diverse communities were receiving different guidance
         from family and friends in their country of origin, and
     -   the needs of people with intellectual disability in terms of vaccination were guite different
         from those with other disabilities.
 The Department engaged the ABS to link Australian Immunisation Register data with the Person­
 Level Integrated Data Asset to generate insights on vulnerable cohorts. These insights were_____

                                                                                                         19
 presented to advisory committees (including people with lived experience) and allowed the
 COVID-19 Vaccine Program to be tailored appropriately to reach all segments of the population.
 Consultation with at risk populations and diversity groups in the early stages of any health
 response is essential to ensure measures are accessible and appropriate to meet their needs.
 Engaging early with people with lived experience to design health responses will ensure
 responses are appropriately informed. Consideration of a culturally appropriate response, health
 liaison roles and community-based programs will enable better reach to at risk people.

      3.5.           COVID-19 treatments
As noted in Section 3.4, early work occurred to understand potential COVID-19 treatments for
Australian purchase. Australia procured and implemented treatment options that worked alongside
the vaccination rollout to help prevent serious disease, hospitalisation and fatality.
Like the vaccine landscape, supply pressures and a competitive global market drove early
procurement of treatment options and remaining informed about of clinical trials and research
around the world. In some cases, supply arrangements were entered into while the treatments were
in the end stages of clinical trials. It was unknown which treatments would be found safe and
effective in clinical trial or if they would receive regulatory approval in Australia. How the COVID-19
virus would develop was also unknown. Australia’s adaptability and prompt actions secured access
to treatments as soon as they were commercially available and approved.
The Department secured a diverse portfolio of COVID-19 therapeutics to treat different stages of the
disease. Advanced purchase agreements (APAs) were established with six pharmaceutical
companies. The APAs supplied hospitals with intravenous treatments such as remdesivir (Veklury®)
for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19. The APAs also supplied oral antivirals
nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid®) and molnupiravir (Lagevrio®), for the treatment of patients in
the community at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease with mild to moderate symptoms.

Access to Treatments
Since February 2022, over 745,000 COVID-19 antiviral treatments have been deployed from the
NMS to State and Territory health departments and other government departments, ACCHOs,
RACHs and the RFDS. Stocks of Lagevrio® were pre-deployed to all RACHs.
The NMS will continue to hold and distribute COVID-19 treatments until 30 April 2024. Oral antiviral
treatments will then be provided through the PBS. State and Territory Governments will manage In­
hospital treatments.
The eligibility criteria for PBS subsidised antivirals focus on those most vulnerable to developing
severe COVID-19 including older Australians (particularly those in RACHs), First Nations people
and those who are immunocompromised. This ensures treatments are accessible and affordable
and are provided to people at risk of severe illness, hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19.
From 1 November 2022, medical practitioners and nurse practitioners were approved to
add Lagevrio and Paxlovid to their Prescriber Bag supplies. This allowed swift commencement of
treatment for aged care residents pre-assessed and deemed suitable for the administration of
COVID-19 oral antiviral treatments.

Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)
Two oral antiviral treatments, Lagevrio® and Paxlovid® were listed on the PBS on 1 March 2022
and 1 May 2022. As at 31 December 2023, over 1,244,090 PBS prescriptions for COVID-19 oral
treatments have been dispensed, with over 819,090 prescriptions of Lagevrio® and 425,000
prescriptions of Paxlovid. The total cost of these prescriptions to the Government is more than
$1.4 billion. As at 5 January 2024, 86,909 prescriptions for Lagevrio (Molnupiravir) have been
issued to residents in RACHs, with a further 8,048 prescriptions issued for Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir +
ritonavir).

                                                                                                       20
Consistent with its PBS-related functions under the National Health Act 1953, the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) continues to assess the effectiveness and safety of these
medicines and the epidemiology of COVID-19. Several updates have occurred to the eligibility
criteria for accessing COVID-19 antivirals in response to emerging evidence.
Refer to Attachment 3 for further information.

Provision of sound and evidence-based advice for clinicians on treatment options for
COVID-19
The National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce (CET) was established in April 2020 to improve
clinician confidence and adherence to best practice when managing COVID-19 cases. The CET
was an independent group funded by the Department.
The CET developed ‘living’ guidelines and recommendations for disease modifying treatments for
the management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Hospitals, the community and
State and Territory health departments used these guidelines extensively in the development and
prioritisation of COVID-19 care pathways.
Funding for the CET was ceased by the Department on 31 December 2022, as part of the transition
to managing COVID-19 within usual funding mechanisms,

Compliance oversight to ensure consumer safety
Part of the TGA’s role, is to investigate alleged importation, advertising, and supply contraventions
of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and relevant regulations. This includes prohibiting the
advertising, import and supply of unapproved therapeutic goods and ensuring there is no
unapproved advertising of therapeutic goods.
The TGA exercised its full range of regulatory powers to protect the safety of Australians from false
or misleading advertising practices of COVID products. This included:
     •         Issuing 166 infringement notices,
     •         issuing 153 direction notices (requiring certain steps be taken in relation to advertising)
     •         entering into two enforceable undertakings, and
     •         initiating other civil or criminal court proceedings12.
Examples of specific cases undertaken by the TGA during COVID-19 can be found in Attachment
4. The full library of cases is also available on the TGA website13.

Ensuring only safe and effective COVID-19 treatments were available in Australia
The TGA put a range of restrictions in place to ensure only safe and effective COVID-19 treatments
were access by Australians. This included preventing the availability of COVID-19 treatments where
there was limited or no evidence to support their efficacy.
For example, the CET and the Advisory Committee for Medicines Scheduling provided advice that
resulted in restrictions on the prescribing of oral ivermectin from 11 September 2021. The TGA
medicines scheduling delegate lifted this restriction on 1 June 2023, noting the TGA still does not
endorse off-label prescribing of ivermectin for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.




12 Infringement notices are an alternative to court action. Payment of such notices is voluntary and not an admission of guilt, however it
can be an effective way of addressing non-compliance. The new regulatory framework has parallel criminal offence or and civil penalty
provisions (for the same types of behaviour), and in general either approach may be taken by TGA investigators seeking to take
regulatory action. Criminal offences have a higher burden of proof and tend to attract smaller pecuniary penalties but may have serious
impacts on the ability to do business and may attract jail time. Civil contraventions tend to attract higher penalties and are particularly
useful in relation to corporations.

 Key Learnings
 Early access to treatments for people in high-risk settings and at-risk populations remains a key
 priority. Continuing to encourage high-risk patients to discuss treatment options with their GP
 before testing positive to COVID-19 is important as new, more effective treatments become
 available.
 Pe-deployment of COVID-19 oral antiviral treatments such as Lagevrio to RACHs ensured older
 Australians in residential aged care received prompt and effective treatment.
 Creation of a rapid Health Technology Assessment (rHTA) pathway enabled the prompt
 assessment of the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 therapeutics. The
 TGA’s full assessment of these therapeutics ensured safety was not compromised.
 The rHTA pathway streamlined consideration by the PBAC of COVID-19 treatments for potential
 PBS listing. Without the rHTA oral antivirals would have taken much longer to be listed on the
 PBS.

         3.6.               Quarantine/repatriation arrangements
While the majority of returning Australians quarantined in hotel quarantine run by States and
Territories, the Department supported the Government’s quarantine efforts.

Repatriation Program
The Department’s role in repatriation and quarantine arrangements provided essential support for
vulnerable Australians stranded overseas. The Centre for National Resilience (the Centre) at
Howard Springs in the Northern Territory (NT) provided a safe and effective environment to
quarantine on entry to Australia. The facility supported Australia’s suppression strategy and enabled
the Government to maintain tight quarantine at the border to protect Australians while vaccines and
treatments were being developed.
Established in October 2020, the Repatriation Program supported more than 22,000 stranded
Australians and humanitarian visa holders across 141 flights to Australia. This was done with no
incursions of COVID-19 between cohorts or into the Australian community. The Government
provided support through a bilateral agreement14 that was varied several times to increase the
facility’s capacity. This increased the quarantine capacity from 500 people to 2000 people per
fortnight.
The Centre was used to quarantine over 1400 humanitarian entrants, primarily from Afghanistan.
Other humanitarian evacuees were uplifted and quarantined in other jurisdictions under separate
arrangements. The Centre also supported the quarantine of the Australian Paralympic team
following the 2021 Tokyo games.
Prior to the Department’s engagement, the Government, via DoD, used Howard Springs to
quarantine passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, as well
as Australians evacuated from Wuhan.
Between 2020 and 2022, over 60,000 people quarantined at the Centre (both through the
Repatriation program and to support the NT’s state-based quarantine).
The Department also supported the Tasmanian Government hosting a repatriation flight; however,
this arrangement was discontinued to allow Tasmania to focus on its state-based quarantine needs.
The role of AUSMAT

resilit nee

                                                                                                                                        22
AUSMAT initially provided quarantine services at the Centre under an arrangement with the NT
Government. Management of the Centre transitioned from an emergency health response to a
larger, more sustainable recovery operation once capacity increased.
The NT developed a state-led model for quarantine delivery, designed to meet the needs of the
expanded Repatriation Program. The NT Public Health Unit and Emergency Management Centre
assumed responsibility for managing the Centre, aligning with quarantine arrangements in other
States and Territories. Around 65% of the clinical workforce previously contracted by AUSMAT
remained at the Centre under NT Health management.

The South Australian home quarantine app
As the pandemic evolved, the Department partnered with jurisdictions to develop solutions for
modified quarantine settings based on risk tiering. For example, the South Australian Home
Quarantine Application (the SAHQ app) was developed by the South Australian Government to
monitor home quarantine in South Australia. In late 2021, the app was expanded to act as a toolkit
to guide those in home quarantine through testing, symptoms, support referrals and the quarantine
itself.
The SAHQ app was made available for Apple and Android users and adapted to meet home
quarantine policy requirements of participating jurisdictions. Support was provided to relevant
jurisdictions to operate trials. The trial concluded on 31 December 2021 with 157,253 people having
used the app.
An assessment of the trial found the app assisted in supporting the management of home
quarantine and should be considered for future emergency responses.

 Key Learnings
 Genuine partnerships with jurisdictions and Commonwealth agencies need to be established with
 clear definitions of roles and responsibilities.
 The Commonwealth’s responsibility for overseeing the operations of quarantine facilities may
 better sit with an agency whose remit covers other border controls. The Department’s role would
 then be advisory, such as advice on incubation periods of virus or infection prevention and
 controls.
 The staged increase of quarantine capacity proved to be effective in supporting the repatriation of
 Australians, while also balancing the risk to the community. This also helped to build a workforce.
 For example, 145 additional nursing staff were upskilled as part of the Repatriation Program and
 subsequently took up roles within the NT health system.
 The quarantine experience at the Centre was largely well received with people having access to
 support and other facilities not available in other arrangements (such as external balconies).
 For future emergency responses, the establishment and use of quarantine facilities may again be
 a critical function. The National Coordination Mechanism proved valuable when coordinating
 issues that required multiple agencies operational and policy insights to implement quickly, like
 quarantine arrangements.

     3.7.            Communication
From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department’s communication functions addressed
issues in real-time with solutions implemented quickly. The Department’s communication capability
and channels strengthened throughout the pandemic.
The Department was the source of truth for mainstream media in the early stages of the pandemic.
Daily press conferences, regular media appearance of Departmental spokespeople and other
communication from the Department became usual practice. The Department’s website and social


                                                                                                   23
media channels surged in popularity with Australians and people from other countries. Key
messages were disseminated widely and quickly, shaping community behavior.
As the pandemic progressed, this approach was complemented by the development of multi­
channel, integrated approaches to communicating consistently and regularly with specific parts of
the community. This included older people, aged care providers, recipients and residents, those
living with disability, First Nations peoples, those from diverse cultural communities and relevant
support bodies.
A Department key priority was making information available and accessible. For example, closed
captioning and Auslan interpreters were used during updates and media briefings. Tailored
communication products and channels were developed in collaboration with stakeholders, and
partnerships were established with community leaders to support them with messaging for their
community.
The Department also managed the COVID-19 communication strategy. The strategy had 30
advertising phases and delivered an integrated and ongoing communication mix of owned, paid and
stakeholder channels to maximise engagement with public health behaviors. Advertising was
adapted and/or translated to ensure relevance to and accessibility by First Nations and culturally
diverse communities.
Weekly meetings with State and Territory Government counterparts linked strategies with state and
territory communication activity. The Department was also a key contributor to weekly meetings of
communication teams from across the Commonwealth. This enabled key messaging to be provided
to agencies to share with their sectors and stakeholders, linkages to be made between
communication strategies and content, and emerging issues to be identified and addressed quickly.
Most advertising encouraged people to access the health.gov.au website, which was positioned as
the ‘source of truth’. As Government messaging began to expand beyond health issues,
Australia.gov.au was introduced as a single gateway to information about the pandemic and
response measures. Health alert pages and resources have attracted over 160 million page views
since the pandemic started.
In close collaboration with jurisdictions, the Department published daily national COVID-19 cases
along with other key indicators to complement the communications strategy and provide the public
access to COVID-19 related data. As the pandemic progressed, the cadence of this reporting was
adapted, eventually tapering from daily to weekly to the now-monthly reports.

Initial communications focus
The messages supporting the early phases of the COVID-19 communication program in 2020
focused on increasing awareness of the importance of physical distancing, good hygiene, support
for vulnerable groups, and COVID-19 testing information for Australians returning from overseas
and at international borders.
With the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in early 2021, communication priorities shifted to promote the
availability and importance of vaccines and how to access them. To support the Department’s
vaccine communication program, the first phase of the COVID-19 vaccination advertising campaign
provided Australians with information on the vaccine safety, testing and TGA approval process.
Later phases focused on promoting eligibility cohorts for each phase of the rollout.

Ongoing communications response
As RATs became available in late 2021, communication focused on changes to testing
requirements. Messaging promoted the availability of free RAT and PCR tests at testing facilities for
people who were a close contact, had symptoms, or were instructed to test by a health authority.
The Department maintained regular communication with the aged care sector on the importance of
RAT test surveillance screening for all staff, workers and visitors.
In July 2022, the Department began promoting the availability of COVID-19 oral treatments to
eligible cohorts, including specific targeting of the aged care sector. This effort was supported by
                                                                                                       24
advertising with messaging focused on eligibility, prescription requirements to access the
medication, and how the treatment can be taken at home.
All phases of the advertising program were rigorously concept tested and ongoing public sentiment
tracking informed future phases of the campaign. This monitoring demonstrated the shifts in
community attitudes and behaviors that were achieved over the course of the pandemic.

Maintaining engagement
The Department used in house medical and healthcare expertise, to support over 90 press
conferences, 200 media interviews and countless Facebook live updates (E.g. the Top 3 at 3) and
webinars. Key departmental spokespeople included the CMO, Deputy CMOs, leadership of the TGA
and the Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer. The Department responded to over 4,000 media
inquiries and 150,000 COVID related emails and received over 50,000 calls from vaccine clinics,
GPs and pharmacies.
Since January 2020, the Department published over 19,000 COVID-19 related posts on social
media channels (Facebook, X, Linkedln, Instagram and YouTube). This resulted in more than
1.6 billion impressions and over 49.5 million direct interactions. The Department’s social media pre­
pandemic audience grew from 159,223 followers to over 1 million followers during, and since, the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The Department translated key health and vaccine information in 63 languages and established a
priority line to support interpreter requirements for appointment bookings. The Department procured
multicultural public relations strategists (Cultural Perspectives) and engaged with multicultural peak
bodies to tailor resources and drive grassroots improvements in vaccination uptake.
The Department partnered with social media and community organisations to produce engaging,
educational videos featuring people with profile and well-known brands. Partnerships included
Australian music group Teeny Tiny Stevies, podcasts like Happy Families, the V8 supercars and the
ACT Brumbies.
The Department attended more than 300 events to promote COVID-19 messaging. There were
more than 9,300 shopping centre information kiosks helping more than 34,000 Australians with
COVID-19 enquiries and vaccinations. To improve local communication efforts, population insights
have been shared with jurisdictions since October 2021.

Ensuring access to information
The Department launched the “Vaccination update” newsletter for citizens as COVID-19
vaccinations became available in Australia. At its peak, the newsletter was sent to more than 37,000
subscribers weekly, sharing crucial advice relating to COVID-19 vaccines, oral antiviral treatments
and protective behaviors. The newsletter has been leveraged to share information on other topics
including winter preparedness and influenza campaign messaging.
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Group on COVID-19 and its Communications
Working Group were established to provide cultural insights and recommendations. First Nations
communication products were developed and delivered to First Nations communities, including via:
•   web pages dedicated to First Nations people - the COVID-19 vaccine web page and a COVID-
    19 information web page,
•   audio and video materials translated in up to 15 Indigenous languages,
•   partnerships with Indigenous community leaders to communicate vaccine information, tackle
    hesitancy and dispel misinformation,
•   case study and spokespeople videos, videos featuring GP and health care workers, social
    media content and radio scripts, and



                                                                                                    25
•   an e-newsletter with 1,039 subscribers providing updates on COVID-19 vaccination information,
    COVID-19 facts, stories and resources.
The pandemic highlighted the diversity of people with disability. The Department developed
capability and established networks to ensure information and messages were shared in multiple
formats, engaging disability organisations to help develop tailored messaging. For example, the
Department engaged the NSW Council for Intellectual Disability and Down Syndrome Australia in
September 2021 to develop targeted communication resources. The Department also published
information in Easy Read.
The Advisory Committee on the Health Emergency Response to COVID-19 for People with
Disability, and its communications working group, were a key to developing tailored health
messaging and identifying appropriate channels to share information.
Between 7 February 2020 and 5 July 2023, over 540 aged care COVID-19 specific Protecting Older
Australians newsletters were distributed, to support those in RACH. Over 80 aged care COVID-19
webinars were held, that included ministers, department executives, in-house experts and key
external stakeholders such as the Older Person Advocacy Network (OPAN).
The Department used an evidence-led approach to communication and engagement, leveraging
data to refine tactics and channels to better meet the needs of older people. This included radio
advertising featuring family or carers, communicating through community groups, local councils and
consumer advocates. Plain English, older voices (the Senior Australian of the Year and Aged Care
Council of Elders members) and images of real people also increased engagement and relevance
of communication activities for this audience.
Further information on the aged care response can be found in Section 4.2.
The Department established the national Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Communities COVID-
19 Health Advisory Group to ensure effective engagement with multicultural communities. On 14
February 2021 the Department launched the COVID-19 Vaccination Program - Culturally and
Linguistically Diverse Communities Implementation Plan'5. This plan, informed by advice from the
advisory group and support of specialist multicultural communication agencies, set out principles to
ensure information was delivered in appropriate languages, formats and locations.
From 1 January 2023, the group was renamed to the CALD Communities Health Advisory Group to
reflect its expanded role to provide advice to shape health and wellbeing policies and programs for
CALD communities across the Health and Aged Care portfolio.
The Department also partnered with the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) to leverage the
relationships between their community liaison officers and culturally diverse communities across
Australia. The community liaison officers provided insights into local community sentiment and
information needs and the Department provided them with messaging and products they could
share with communities.

Mental Health campaigns
In response to reports of increased personal stress and anxiety in early 2020, several
communication campaigns were developed. The "How's Your Head Today?" campaign addressed
the significant physical, mental, and economic challenge and included videos, animations, radio
advertisements and how-to guides were developed. Products featured themes of emotional
wellbeing, keeping connected, recognising signs of poor mental health, seeking help, maintaining
physical wellbeing and supporting young people.

                                                                                                                                      26
Trust in government messaging
Community sentiment showed high initial trust in Government and the COVID-19
messages. Through the first half of 2020, published monitors indicated that the perception the
Government was doing a good job managing COVID remained high before declining in mid-2020.
Confusion about messages primarily occurred when there was variation among jurisdiction in
relation to the public health and social measures and vaccination requirements that differed with the
nationally agreed guidance.

Tackling COVID-19 misinformation and vaccine hesitancy
The Department worked with peak bodies and other government agencies to distribute credible
COVID-19 information to counter misinformation and address vaccine hesitancy. Social media ads
were run and formally moderated throughout the public campaign. Comments were responded to on
social media posts, correcting misinformation and directing people to the correct information on the
health.gov.au, TGA and WHO websites. Prompt moderation of social media posts ensured the
Australian public had access to safe and reliable information. The Department received and
moderated over 50,000 comments per month during the peak of the pandemic.

 Key Learnings
 Early in the pandemic, the Department struggled to reach and engage younger audiences.
 Identification and partnership with key social media platforms, enabled the Department to reach
 these audiences in novel ways. Other key learning include:
     •    Managing COVID-19 fatigue: As the pandemic progressed and ‘COVID fatigue’ set in,
          maintaining engagement became challenging. The department realigned messaging to
          focus on priority groups, promoting ATAGI’s updated recommendations on vaccination
          and oral antiviral treatments to high-risk communities. The Department is still
          communicating key messages about COVID-19, but the approach is similar to other
          communicable diseases like influenza.
     •    Communicating with diverse audiences: Leveraging existing channels and partnerships
          with peak organisations, local influencers and trusted voices, is critical to effectively
          deliver information to diverse audiences.
     •    Use of data to target communications: The Department’s strategic use of COVID-19
          vaccine data to identify locations and population groups with low vaccination uptake
          allowed a highly targeted media buy through geo-targeted advertising placement.
     •    Use of trusted experts: the CMO, CNMO and Deputy CMO provided a team of trusted
          voices. Given the protracted COVID-19 emergency it was important to have more than
          one person to allow for sustainability.
 National Consistency: Establishing mechanisms to agree positions and an understanding of the
 impact of differing messages on the community is necessary, especially where decisions are
 made to deviate from agreed position.


  4. Broader health measures
 Relevant Term(s) of Reference: Broader health supports for people impacted by COVID-19
 and/or lockdowns (for example mental health and suicide prevention supports, and access
 to screening and other preventive health measures).

      4.1.           Health care supports
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated health reforms that may not have been achievable without the
collective efforts of various governments, stakeholders and community groups. The pandemic also
highlighted the need for flexible and scalable models of care, particularly within primary care.
The Government invested in a range of health and care supports to reduce the spread of COVID-19
and improve the resilience and performance of the health system. Many of these measures have
improved health care access across Australia including access to virtual and other healthcare
channels not previously available.
The primary healthcare system, largely the responsibility of the Commonwealth, continues to play
an essential role in the COVID-19 response. This includes assessing, testing and managing
infectious respiratory disease patients, administering COVID-19 vaccinations and prescribing
COVID-19 treatments. Primary care services continue to provide care for COVID-19 patients,
including escalation to hospitals, managing patients after discharge from hospital, providing front
line mental health services, and supporting patients with Long COVID symptoms.
Some of the supports introduced in response to the pandemic have become embedded elements of
the health system, such as expanded MBS telehealth items and electronic prescribing. Other
enduring features include the national triage services through Healthdirect, better infection
prevention and control (in primary and aged care) and the increased capability of PHNs to
coordinate care in the community. Other elements, which provided temporary additional health
system capacity to support the emergency response, were progressively scaled back over time.

Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme amendments
During the pandemic, the Government introduced a wide range of additional services under the
MBS and PBS to support healthcare provision via virtual/digital channels. These adjustments were
aimed at reducing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 and provide protection for both
patients and healthcare providers. These changes ensured patients had access to essential health
services, and relieved pressure on hospitals by enabling healthcare providers to manage COVID­
positive people in the community. This also supported GPs, allied health providers and specialists to
continue providing essential health care services during periods where patient or provider
movement was restricted by lock downs.
MBS Telehealth
From March 2020 to 31 December 2023, 169.3 million services have been provided to more than
20 million patients. Over the same period, more than 100,000 health professionals have provided
MBS telehealth services and $8.4 billion in benefits have been paid.
Many amendments were made to the MBS to support access to health services and mitigate the
risk of COVID-19 transmission. The rapid deployment of MBS telehealth measures aligned with the
Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus’.


                                                                                                      28
The rapid expansion of telehealth services (which included video and phone consultations) was
staged according to the health needs of the community. It was also informed by regular consultation
with stakeholders including experts, patients, and the latest available research. Implementation of
targeted items for smoking cessation, mental health, and blood borne virus and sexual reproductive
health occurred alongside general telehealth items. Support for admitting health professionals to
consult with their patients in hospital via telehealth also occurred.
Refinements were made to a range of telehealth services as COVID-19 impacts and use of
telehealth items were observed. Consideration was given to quality of care, and how telehealth can
support equivalent outcomes to in-person care, given common clinical requirements for telehealth
and face-to-face services.
Telehealth evolved over time, with most of the telehealth items introduced now becoming a
permanent feature of the health landscape. This included increased access to a broader range of
telehealth compared to before the COVID-19 response, particularly for GPs, specialists, nurse
practitioners and allied health professionals.
Telehealth measures specific to the COVID-19 response have also evolved over time. Current
temporary telehealth measures include:
    -   long telephone consultations for eligible patients’ assessments for suitability of COVID-19
        oral antiviral medicines.
    -   Patients with a recently confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or suspected infection requiring
        confirmation via PCR pathology tests can access MBS telehealth services from any
        available GP.
These measures will cease 30 June 2024.
Lessons from the COVID-19 response have informed the MBS’ response capability for future
natural disasters. Legislated provisions now enable increased access to MBS GP telehealth
services in affected regions, as identified by States and Territories.
On 1 March 2023, the MBS Review Advisory Committee (MRAC) formally commenced a post­
implementation review of telehealth arrangements. The scope of the post-implementation review of
telehealth included:
•   Permanent and temporary MBS funded telehealth services.
•   The MBS Review Taskforce’s Telehealth Principles, which were published in 2020 and have
    informed policy to date.
•   The appropriateness of current settings for video and telephone consultations to ensure the right
    balance of access, quality, and safety.
The review has been informed by targeted and public consultation as well as engagement with
health experts, peak organisations, researchers, and consumers who have provided evidence and
advice. Interim advice from MRAC was provided to the Government in late 2023, and final
recommendations will be provided by 31 March 2024. The Government will consider MRAC’s final
advice and recommendations in due course.
Other MBS changes
From 8 November 2021 to 31 December 2022, a temporary MBS item was available to support
medical practitioners providing clinically relevant face-to-face treatment to COVID-19 positive
patients.
The Government also made available temporary MBS items to improve multidisciplinary care
access, to support residents of aged care homes deconditioning due to COVID restrictions and
inactivity. These items included up to an additional 5 physical therapy sessions and up to 2
additional exercise physiology group services per calendar year.
E-prescribing

                                                                                                      29
E-prescribing was originally part of the 2018/19 Budget. The intent was that by 2022 all prescribers
and pharmacists would have access to electronic prescribing and dispensing. The COVID-19
pandemic saw this measure brought forward for implementation in May 2020. This expedited roll­
out, alongside a growth in pharmacy delivery services, enabled patients to access medications
without being limited by lockdowns, COVID-19 infection, or location. It also reduced the risk of
infection among health professionals by limiting exposure to COVID-19 positive patients.
From March 2020 to 31 December 2023 over 191 million electronic prescriptions (e-scripts) were
issued, by more than 78,000 prescribers (GPs and nurse practitioners). E-prescribing has become a
permanent feature of the Australian health system with over 98% of pharmacies across Australia
now able to dispense medication to patients via e-prescriptions.

General Practice-led Respiratory Clinics (GPRCs)
GPRCs were established early in the pandemic to conserve PPE and divert people with mild to
moderate respiratory symptoms from other general practices and public hospitals, particularly
emergency departments.
The initial purpose of GPRCs was to assess patients with respiratory symptoms and carry out PCR
tests to confirm diagnoses. Although not part of the original objectives, disease surveillance became
an important component of the program. GPRC scalable capacity was an important part of
Australia’s response, successfully reducing the burden on key parts of the primary care
infrastructure.
From January 2022, GPRCs began providing treatment services to COVID-19 positive patients
through face-to-face and telehealth consultations, including the prescription of anti-viral
medications.
At the peak, there were 150 GPRCs nationally providing primary care services to individuals,
including those ineligible for Medicare, at no cost to the patient. Gap analysis and needs
assessments determined the site locations. Equitable access to relevant care during COVID 19 was
the key criterion. During the program, which ran from March 2020 to February 2023, GPRCs
collectively delivered more than:
•   3.5 million consultations for patients presenting with respiratory illness,
•   3 million tests for COVID-19,
•   2.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, and
•   80 thousand COVID-19 positive consultations.
GPRCs serviced people from 2,540 postcodes nationally, covering 99.8% of the population.
General Practice-led Respiratory Clinic Panel
The GPRC Panel includes 111 existing accredited general practices with suitable infrastructure,
infection prevention controls and workforce. It will be held in reserve to respond at short notice to a
future respiratory health emergency, if necessary.
In non-emergency times, participating practices provide their usual services through standard MBS
items.

Primary Health Networks
PHNs were established in 2015 to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health services.
During the pandemic, PHNs initially assisted in PPE distribution to primary care providers. More
than 34.5 million units of PPE were provided via PHNs.
The role of PHNs evolved throughout the pandemic, with PHNs bringing together their local
knowledge and ability to bridge elements of the health care system provided by the Commonwealth
and state and territory governments. The PHNs developed regional community pathways for


                                                                                                      30
COVID-19 positive people, while ensuring plans were in place for management and escalation
through the community health system.
Between October 2021 and June 2023, PHNs were funded to commission home visits to avoid
unnecessary escalation of patients to hospital. PHNs commissioned medical services, GPs,
Aboriginal Health Workers, nurse practitioners and practice nurses to undertake home visits for
treatment of COVID-19 symptoms, or for other medical needs that could not be delivered by
telehealth.
In the first half of 2023, PHNs contacted over 1,400 disability accommodation settings to ensure
residents had appropriate access to primary care providers. PHNs support disability
accommodation to arrange vaccinations, on or off-site, with local primary care providers and further
support the development of relationships between the accommodation and primary care providers.

Other Health Supports
Healthdirect Australia (Healthdirect)
Healthdirect is a national health information and advisory service. The pandemic brought about a
systemic change as to how all States and Territories use Healthdirect.
Healthdirect operated the National Coronavirus Helpline (NCH) from March 2020 to
December 2023. The NCH handled almost five million calls and operated 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. The NCH also included a free interpreting service and had several dedicated priority
lines providing support to:
•    COVID-19 positive patients,
•    aged and disability care workers,
•    First Nations peoples, and
•    people with disability, their carers, family and friends.
Healthdirect also operated the Living with COVID (LwC) program from January 2022 to
October 2023. The LwC included a helpline connect COVID-19 positive consumers to the right level
of care. The LwC helpline handled more than 560,000. The CSIRO’s digital health and research
program conducted an independent evaluation of the LwC program16. It found that the LwC helpline
adapted well to changing circumstances such as snap lockdowns and ‘spikes’ in case numbers,
increased health literacy and enabled members of the public to make informed decisions about their
care. The evaluation found the LwC helpline successfully connected consumers to primary care
enabling early intervention and was deployed as a scalable model for patient triage and care
access.
Both helplines were transitioned to sustainable business as usual arrangements within the
Healthdirect suite of services.
Healthdirect provided other services to support Australians during the pandemic. For example, the
Easy Vaccine Access (EVA) concierge call back service addressed access barriers. The EVA
supported more than 17,000 vaccine bookings. In addition, the COVID-19 symptom and antiviral
eligibility checker was created and is available in 11 languages. This tool was accessed by more
than 16.2 million uses.
COVID-19 Practice Incentives Program (PIP)
The Practice Incentive Program encourages general practices to continue providing quality care,
enhance capacity, and improve access and health outcomes for patients. The COVID-19 PIP was




16 https://media.healthdirect.orq.au/publications/CSIRO Livinq-with-COVID-proqram-evaluation.pdf

                                                                                                   31
established to encourage continuity of care and follow-ups for patients receiving the COVID-19
vaccine.
General practices needed to be accredited under the Royal Australian College of General
Practitioners (RACGP) Standards and follow the National Vaccine Storage Guidelines to be eligible
participants. This provided assurance that selected practices had cold chain management
processes in place and effective procedures to maintain the shelf life and potency of the COVID-19
vaccines. General practices could claim $10 per eligible patient that received both first dose and
second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at the same practice.
A total of 8,217 practice payments were made to general practices under this program.
Later in 2021, the COVID-19 In-reach Vaccination Incentive was introduced to support general
practices undertake in-reach COVID-19 vaccination services for aged care and disability support
workers in their workplace. Once the minimum threshold for workers had been met, it was
expanded to allow payments for in-reach services to residents in aged care homes or disability
residential facilities.
General practices could claim $1,000 for a minimum of 50 COVID-19 assessment services through
an in-reach vaccination clinic, with additional payments of $20 per service to a worker or resident
thereafter. A total of 74 practice payments were made to general practices who undertook in-reach
vaccination services.
Strengthening Medicare - General Practice Grants Program
The Government provided funding from April 2023 for the Strengthening Medicare - General
Practice Grants Program. General Practices and eligible ACCHOs can access the program to
expand patient access and improve their services across Australia.
The program provides a one-off grant (between $25,000 to $50,000 based on practice size and
accreditation status) to each general practice and eligible ACCHO to make investments in
innovation, training, equipment, and minor capital works in one or more of three investments
streams:
•   enhance digital health capability,
•   upgrade infection prevention and control arrangements to increase capacity to treat COVID-19
    positive and other respiratory patients in a general practice setting, and
•   maintain and/or achieve accreditation.




                                                                                                  32
Key Learnings
The Australian health system was largely able to adapt to COVID-19-related movement restrictions
through substituting face to face care modalities with virtual care modalities. While this was
successful for many interventions, it did not suit all types of care. The full impact of the emergency
phase of the pandemic on the long-term health of people who many have missed health care due
to lock downs and restrictions is likely unknown.
The role of primary care is critical in every Australian health emergency response. Throughout the
pandemic, primary care providers have demonstrated their value, quickly adapting their services
and dealing with challenges for patients and health professionals. Detailed consideration of the role
of primary care in emergency response preparedness is vital to ensure Australia can move quickly
in future possible pandemics.
Defined roles and responsibilities of primary care providers would benefit future preparedness,
while maintaining flexibility to respond appropriately depending on the emergency health situation.
Considering the role of PHNs in future emergency responses should also occur. PHNs potential
contribution should be clearly defined, and they should participate in pre-pandemic planning
exercises.
For the GPRC program, lessons were recognised and applied through the development of an
emergency response capability via the GPRC Panel. Other key lessons from the original GPRC
program include:
•   Reliance on temporary infrastructure was not sustainable from a financial or health perspective,
    and
•   Engaging general practices through contracts reduces data integrity as consultations are not
    centrally recorded and fees are not linked to an individual practitioner’s provider number.

      4.2.             Aged Care Support
Support for older Australians was central to the Department’s response planning. From the
beginning of the pandemic, the Department supported aged care providers to implement measures
to prevent or reduce the risk COVID-19 from entering RACHs. This included providing:
        o    on-site vaccinations,
        o    guidance around IPC protocols and managing visitations to aged care homes,
        o    daily monitoring and case management,
        o    regular on-site PCR testing, and
        o    provision of surge workforce, PPE and RATs when outbreaks occurred.
The Department published the first overarching plan for management of COVID-19 for Australia
through the AHPPC on 31 January 2020. This was followed by a specific National COVID-19 Aged
Care Plan that National Cabinet endorsed in August 2020. The plan outlined the national approach
for supporting the aged care sector to prevent, prepare, respond and recover from COVID-19.
This plan was further updated in late 2020 to consolidate learnings from the initial phases of the
pandemic and included specific guidance, information and tools to support aged care recipients,
their families, the aged workforce and providers of aged care services. As the pandemic evolved,
more targeted guidance was developed to support the sector, including winter and summer
preparedness plans.
The aged care sector’s initial response to COVID-19 took a strong risk averse approach. At times,
this meant implementing stringent restrictions on visitations and movement within and between
RACHs. The Department supported providers to increase their IPC and emergency planning
capabilities. This included providing regular guidance around furloughing staff and visitation to

                                                                                                      33
RACHs based on AHPPC advice. As preparedness capabilities increased the sector moved
towards a risk-based approach that balanced the need for strong IPC protocols with the physical,
social and emotional needs of older people. This change was supported by high vaccination rates
among residents of aged care homes and oral antivirals treatments becoming available.
Outbreaks impacted the health and well-being of residents through the direct impact of COVID-19
infections and beyond with broader health issues linked to isolation and quarantining requirements.
Repeated COVID-19 waves also impacted aged care staff, with COVID-19 related furloughing and
isolation requirements exacerbating existing workforce shortages across the sector.

Key aged care support
Most RACHs experienced at least one COVID-19 outbreak. The Department provided additional
supports for RACHs to deal with these outbreaks, such as directly reimbursing facilities for the costs
incurred of dealing with an outbreak and additional funding to ensure the viability of homes. A range
of workforce supports including supplementary workforce through agency staff and deploying ADF
personnel and upskilling existing workforce through IPC training were also provided.
Further details on additional supports provided to the aged care sector and older people during
COVID-19 can be found at Attachment 5.

 Key learnings
 Throughout the pandemic there was tension between restrictions applied to and by aged care
 services and the settings that were applicable to the broader community. This created a
 challenge for the sector in balancing the human rights of aged care residents to interact with
 family, friends, loved ones and carers, with the real risks to health and lifespan of residents.
 Noting these tensions, the impact of COVID-19 on residential aged care has been significant, with
 over 6,000 COVID-19 related resident deaths in aged care over the course of the pandemic.
 Since 2020, there has been a significant reduction in COVID-19 case mortality in aged care from
 33% of cases in 2020 to 1.6% of cases in 2024. This reduction is due to a range of factors
 including greater preparedness of the sector and the availability of effective vaccines and
 treatments.
 The pandemic occurred concurrently with the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and
 Safety, which highlighted deficiencies in the aged care system and recognised the system was
 already under strain. The Royal Commission also noted the aged care system was not
 adequately prepared to respond to a significant outbreak, such as the COVID-19 virus. Some of
 the key challenges in the sector’s response included:
 •   turnover in leadership positions or low staffing levels due to worker fatigue and burnout,
 •   limited IPC expertise and significant gaps in IPC practice, and
 •   complacency in stocking or correctly using PPE.
 The absence of robust screening procedures to identify cases early increased the risk and
 challenges of managing an outbreak.
 In addition to the Royal Commission and other external reviews, the Department continued to
 adapt its approach guided by advice from the sector, AHPPC and ACAG, and State and Territory
 officials. Two of the key measures implemented in response to this advice and feedback was the
 introduction of IPC leads and access to additional aged care surge workforce.
 In December 2020 all RACHs were required to have a dedicated IPC Lead. The fourth COVID-19
 wave saw smaller spikes in cases, less severe outbreaks, and fewer resident deaths per cases,
 compared with earlier waves. This suggests improved preparedness in aged care homes.



                                                                                                    34
 As of 9 February 2024, the Surge Workforce Support Program has covered 188,069 shifts in
 aged care services impacted by COVID-19. It includes GPs, nurses, care workers, allied health
 workers, executive and ancillary staff.
 The surge workforce support program provided more than 200 deployable resources nationally to
 support RACHs experiencing critical staff shortages.
 Access to time limited surge workforce ensures aged care homes are adequately supported. The
 program creates a stabilising and protective effect providing quality care and service to older
 Australians.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Aged Care Quality Standards were strengthened to
 include specific outcomes on emergency and disaster management (Outcome 2.10) and infection
 prevention and control (Outcome 4.2). Note, the final draft of the strengthened Quality Standards
 is not yet in operation but will be incorporated into and implemented as part of the new Aged Care
 Act (see Section 6).

        4.3.          Mental health and suicide prevention supports
Public health and social measures were highly successful at preventing the spread of COVID-19 at
the beginning of the pandemic. However, these measures (such as lock downs and density limits)
came at a significant social and economic cost and had, in some cases, serious mental health
impacts. Psychological distress remained elevated throughout 2023, underlining the importance of
continued support in this area.
The legacy of COVID-19 and its associated lockdowns continues to impact the mental wellbeing of
the Australian community, with two in five Australians reporting their mental health has been
affected by the pandemic. Digital service provider data confirms that service demand is higher than
pre-pandemic levels. Other data and research indicates the mental health impacts of the pandemic,
including grief, economic hardship and social isolation, will continue for some time. There is
emerging evidence of the long-term psychological and cognitive impacts of long-COVID, estimated
to affect about 5% of Australians. This is likely to contribute to ongoing demand for mental health
support.

Whole of Population Supports
An early component of the Government’s mental health response was the National Mental Health
and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan (Response Plan). The Response Plan’s core objective
was for Australians to prioritise their mental health in line with physical health, and set out advice to
help navigate this.
Beyond the initial funding committed under the Response Plan, the Government subsequently
implemented a range of mental health supports, including:
    •    Temporarily increasing the number of psychological therapy sessions available to an
         individual under the Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners
         program, from 10 to 20 sessions. Medicare-subsidised telehealth services were also
         available,
    •        Increased funding to a range of digital mental health services, and
    •    Support for PHNs to commission mental health nurses to provide in-reach mental health
         services for older Australians experiencing social isolation or loneliness.
For more information on whole of population mental health support, please see Attachment 6.

Support for Target Populations
The pandemic caused changes to the way Australian’s lived, worked, learned and engaged in
every aspect of society, contributing to stress and anxiety. Different supports were needed for
different cohorts and the Department addressed this through implementation of a range of
measures for different cohorts, including:

                                                                                                       35
    •    Supporting the mental health of people in mandatory quarantine through a range of
         specifically designed digital, telephone and telehealth mental health services,
    •    Support for people in isolation by promoting geo-location-relevant COVID-19 alerts and
         information, encouraging help seeking behaviour and prompts for early intervention,
    •    Support for residents of RACHs, by funding a range of measures to address isolation. The
         eligibility of the Better Access program was expanded to allow RACH residents access
         treatment via GP referral in line with referral pathways in the broader community,
    •        Additional funding for Healthdirect to collate and disseminate mental health information,
    •    Support for children and young people, through funding programs in schools and other
         programs, and
    •    Support for First Nation’s social and emotional wellbeing by developing a suite of culturally
         appropriate COVID-19 resources.
For more information targeted mental health support, please see Attachment 6.

Suicide Prevention
The Department worked closely with jurisdictions to monitor deaths by suicide, including through
investment in the AIHW Suicide and Self-Harm Monitoring System (SSHMS). National suicide data,
published annually in the ABS Causes of Death publication, does not show an increase in deaths by
suicide in either 2020 or 2021.
In 2021, 81 of the people who died by suicide had the COVID-19 pandemic identified as a risk
factor, which represents 2.6% of all suicides. This is a reduction from 3.2% in 2020.

 Key Learnings
 Throughout the pandemic the Department assembled a detailed knowledge base of the impacts
 of the pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of the broad population. This included
 understanding how it impacted different population groups and locations at different points in
 time. Other recent events such as the 2019-20 bushfires, flooding events, and other disasters and
 isolation added to this knowledge.
 Learnings from the more vulnerable or those at-risk of experiencing mental health difficulties, will
 be considered in future mental health response measures. This will include lessons from aged
 care recipients, older people, children and youth, as well as consideration of workforce
 requirements to support surges in demand, particularly over a long period of time.
 Central to the rapid implementation of many of the COVID-19 mental health initiatives was
 leveraging existing relationships with the States and PHNs. For example, the Head to Health
 initiative was able to be stood up in 4 weeks as it used existing infrastructure within established
 primary care settings.



        4.4.               Impacts to screening programs and services
Screening and preventative health access
Medical screening and preventative health were impacted by the pandemic. As outlined in Cancer
Australia’s paper on COVID-19 Recovery17, the pandemic disrupted the three national population
cancer screening programs for breast, cervical and bowel cancers.




17 Cancer Australia 2021. The impact of COVID-19 on cancer-related medical services and procedures in Australia in 2020

                                                                                                                          36
In 2020 and 2022 there were 163,595 and 158,211 fewer cancer-related diagnostic procedures,
based on 2017 - 2019 trends. This may result in more cancers being diagnosed at a later stage.
Breast cancer screening
AIHW’s BreastScreen Australia Monitoring Reports showed that participation in the BreastScreen
Program dropped from 55% in 2018-2019 to 48% in 2020-21.
Suspension of some BreastScreen services occurred between 2020 and 2022 in response to public
health requirements and flooding. Modelling suggests a short delay between regular screening
mammograms is unlikely to change the long-term outcomes of any detected cancers. During these
suspensions some BreastScreen Australia staff were redeployed for COVID-19 related care.
BreastScreen Australia received funding from 2022 to 2024 to boost the capacity to re-engage
women and catch up on delayed screening.
Cervical cancer screening
The National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) continued to operate during COVID-19. The
NCSP changed from 2-yearly Pap tests to 5-yearly Cervical Screening Tests in December 201718.
With this change, the number of Cervical Screening Tests conducted was expected to be lower in
2020 compared to 2019. In 2020 843,971 fewer tests were conducted than in 2019. There were
fewer cervical screening tests in April 2020, and to a lesser extent in May 202019 than expected.
However, there was an ongoing trend towards increased participation over the 2018-2022 period,
with participation reaching 68%.
Bowel cancer screening
The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) continued to invite eligible Australians to
screen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Screening participation rates dropped from 43.8% in
2019-2020 to 40.9% in 2020-2021, however subsequent research undertaken by Cancer Council in
2023 indicated that natural disasters had more of an impact than the pandemic. While high COVID-
19 case numbers led to a relative decrease of 5% in kit return rates, the research also found 15+
day lockdowns within a month led to a 10% increase in bowel screening kit returns20.
The median time between the positive screen and a follow-up diagnostic assessment increased
from 49 days (for the period 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2020) to 58 days (for the period
1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021).
The NBCSP received additional funding in March 2022 to support access to colonoscopy and grow
capacity to process those procedures delayed due to the pandemic.
In support for screening activities, the Cancer Council Australia ran a campaign between September
and November 2020 and between March and April 2021, to encourage Australians who had
delayed cancer screening to ‘Put Cancer Screening Back on Your To-Do List’.

Travel restrictions to support vulnerable populations
Responding to calls from the First Nations community, on 20 March 2020, the National Cabinet
provided in-principal agreement to restrict travel in and out of specified remote communities. This
was done in partnership with the community, under the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Biosecurity Act) with
the aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19 to vulnerable populations, including First Nations
people.

Other Health Supports
Palliative care: carinq@home COVID-19 supplement packs
To assist people within home palliative care, the Department commissioned the development of a
COVID-19 Supplement Pack as an adjunct to the standard palliative care caring@home pack. The
supplement pack reduced the reliance on the telehealth and palliative care clinical workforces and
alleviated the pressure of equipment shortages during the height of the COVID-19 outbreak. The
supplement pack contained clinical equipment and provided and information and educational video
illustrating how to use the clinical equipment. Over 10,000 caring@home supplement packs were
provided across Australia.
Hearing Services Program (HSP)
The HSP supports hearing services for almost one million eligible Australians. During COVID-19,
fewer people were able to attend appointments, temporary providers closed and there was general
reduced service availability for an immediate period.
A range of HSP program services can be delivered by teleaudiology (telehealth). In 2020, the
Government funded development of national teleaudiology guidelines to support best practice
delivery of teleaudiology services.
The Department adapted HSP processes, temporarily removing some documentation requirements
in response to barriers presented by COVID-19 public health restrictions. This allowed client
consent and agreement for services to be given electronically or verbally over the phone. Post­
pandemic, the program continues to allow electronic or verbal client consent for some program
services.
Program data showed these measures were effective in ensuring access to hearing services. By
April 2020, the rate of new clients accessing the program had fallen by 80%, and service delivery
levels fell by approximately 20% between March to June 2020.By July 2020, new client rates and
service delivery had returned to pre-pandemic levels.
With the temporary removal of the requirement for written client agreement for maintenance from
March 2020 through to 30 June 2021, there was a $34 million increase to device maintenance
expenditure. With the reintroduction of client agreement to maintenance, maintenance related
expenditure has reduced to pre-pandemic levels.
There was also an increase in the reported number and claims for replacement devices. Providers
advised that there were increased rates of lost devices due to challenges with mask wearing. Since
the reintroduction of evidence requirements and reduced COVID-19 prevalence, replacements rates
have commenced returning to pre-pandemic levels.
Consumer protections
To protect Australian consumers, the Government implemented several determinations made by the
Health Minister throughout the pandemic to prevent price gouging and exportation of critical sanitary
and medical products, essential goods, and RATs.
Disruptions to the health system
Following a decision by the National Cabinet restrictions were applied to selected elective surgeries
from 26 March 2020. This decision was made to preserve PPE stocks in Australia and ensure there
were adequate staff and beds in case Australia experienced a surge in COVID-19 related
hospitalisations.
Under these restrictions, only Category 1 and exceptional Category 2 procedures could be
undertaken. These restrictions were eased (but not fully lifted) from 29 April 2020, allowing all
Category 2 and some important Category 3 procedures to be performed. Suspensions then
occurred on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis to create additional hospital capacity and ensure
those who needed acute COVID-19 hospital care were able to receive it.


                                                                                                     38
Elective surgery restrictions had a significant impact on the private sector, which ordinarily make up
over half of all elective surgeries.
Private Hospital Viability Guarantee
To ensure private hospital beds and the private hospital workforce were available to supplement
public hospitals during COVID-19 outbreaks, the Government provided financial assistance through
COVID-19 Partnership. This also ensured the viability of the private hospital sector and the ability to
resume normal operations at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government’s contribution
covered the gap between each private hospital’s minimum viability costs and any revenue received
by that private hospital. This resulted in a cost to the Government of $1.5 billion over the period that
it was in place, from 3 April 2020 to 30 September 2022.
Private hospitals were successfully used during the Victorian COVID-19 wave in late 2020, with
more than 500 patients accommodated in response to outbreaks in RACHs. In other jurisdictions
there was less success with this approach. Some private hospitals considered that they did not
have the right capability to care for this cohort. It was also observed that often private hospital staff
were already working across the public hospital or aged care sectors.
Private hospital capacity was also used to supplement the public hospital system. For example,
transferring surgical cases to a private hospital to allow a nearby public hospital to dedicate
additional capacity for patients with COVID-19.
Pathology Sector Viability
The Government provided funding to private pathology providers to ensure they were able to remain
operating and provide essential testing services. This was also in recognition that major pathology
providers were ineligible for JobKeeper due to their size of their businesses. One of the three major
private pathology providers applied for and received grant funding to provide a revenue guarantee
from April-September 2020 to ensure that essential pathology testing was maintained.
Private health insurers commitment to support sector recovery
Private health insurers committed to not profit from the COVID-19 pandemic given the restrictions
on members’ access to hospital and services and treatments, and subsequent reduction in claims.
The Department, in consultation with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the
Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the private health insurance sector, developed a
framework to monitor private health insurers against their commitments1
Health insurers provided premium relief and expanded the benefits available to Australians who
hold private health insurance. Some of these initiatives have included:
•   deferral of 2020, 2021 and 2022 premium changes,
•   extending their products to cover all COVID-19 related claims,
•   allowing policy holders to suspend their policy and reactivate it without re-serving waiting
    periods,
•   waiving premiums for policy holders experiencing financial hardship while honoring benefit
    claims, and
•   supporting members via rebates, short term premium reductions, extension of benefits, and roll­
    over of benefits into the next calendar year.
As of 30 June 20232, insurers had returned 84.7% of estimated permanent claims savings to policy
holders ($3.5 billion). Givebacks by insurers will continue to be announced and made after this date.




                                                                                                        39
    Key Learnings
    Private Hospital Guarantee
    While the Private Hospital Guarantee was used during the Victorian Aged Care Outbreak in 2020,
    its overall utility in supporting other aged care outbreaks was not as strong. Hospital beds and
    equipment proved to be less of a constraint than workforce, and private hospital staff often
    already had jobs working across other sectors. The guarantee was, however, effective in
    preserving a viable private hospital sector, which has been able to contribute to delivering catch­
    up services to help address the impacts of care deferred due to the pandemic.
    Cancer screening
    The NCSP continues to explore the possibility of improved home-based screening services. This
    includes the screening for cervical cancer through self-collection of vaginal samples supported by
    telehealth consultations. This could provide access to cervical screening in situations where
    eligible people could not physically visit the healthcare providers.
    Home delivery of screening tests by the NBSCP ensured screening could continue to be
    accessed during the pandemic. Further flexibility has been provided by enabling GPs to issue
    program kits directly to patients via telehealth, face to face consultations or by mail.
    The National Lung Cancer Screening Program due to commence in July 2025 will consider the
    key learnings from the existing cancer screening programs.


     5. International Policies
    Relevant Term(s) of Reference: International policies to support Australians at home and
    abroad (including with regard to international border closures and securing vaccine supply
    deals with international partners for domestic use in Australia).

In this section:
•     5.1 - Restrictions on travel to and from Australia
•     5.2 - Travel requirements - masks, screening pre-departure testing, vaccination and
      declarations
•     5.3 - Response to Outbreaks: Australian Medical Assistance Teams deployment
•     5.4 - International engagement with partners on vaccine supply
•     5.5 - International engagement and assistance including on surveillance
Refer to the relevant section for:
•     3.1 - National Medical Stockpile including PPE provision
•     3.4 and 3.5 - COVID-19 vaccine and treatment rollouts
•     3.5 - Quarantine / Repatriation arrangements
        5.1.            Restrictions on travel to and from Australia
Australia’s COVID-19 suppression strategy sought to reduce the risk of COVID-19 at its
international border. The then Health Minister implemented international travel restrictions via
Determinations under the Biosecurity Act. These decisions were supported by medical advice that
considered the perceived severe and immediate threat to human health. Australia was one of the
first countries in the world to implement international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19.
The Biosecurity Act enabled the Government to make the necessary human health requirements at
the international border. Under section 42 of the Biosecurity Act, the “Human coronavirus with

                                                                                                      40
pandemic potential” (which included SARS-CoV-221/COVID-19) was included as a Listed Human
Disease on 21 January 2020.

Initial response
Travel restrictions were progressively implemented over the course of the pandemic. Starting on
1 February 2020, foreign nationals that had been to mainland China were required to quarantine for
14 days prior to entering Australia. On 20 March 2020, Australia’s international borders were closed
to all non-citizens and non-residents. From this date, all Australians and permanent residents were
required to undertake managed quarantine for 14 days in a hotel or other accommodation upon
arrival in Australia.
On 18 March 2020 an Emergency Determination banned all cruise ships entering Australian waters
and required those in Australian waters to leave. The ban ended when the Human Biosecurity
Emergency Period relating to COVID-19 in Australia lapsed on 17 April 2022.
By 25 March 2020, the Government implemented a ‘travel ban’ on all Australians departing
Australia to travel overseas (unless an exemption applied), through an Emergency Determination
under the Biosecurity Act. Many of these measures were conceptualised, discussed by Ministers
and implemented on the same day.

Ongoing response
By mid to late 2020, National Cabinet began considering steps to enable reopening of Australia’s
borders. This included the staged increases in international arrival caps and the creation of safe
travel zones.
A one-way safe travel zone with New Zealand commenced on 16 October 2020, enabling
passengers who had been in New Zealand to travel to Australia without needing to quarantine on
arrival. The safe travel zone was suspended several times in 2021 in response to outbreak clusters.
On 22 March 2021, a determination was made to allow Australian citizens and permanent residents
to travel to New Zealand from Australia without needing to seek an exemption from the ABF. Two­
way quarantine-free travel between Australia and New Zealand subsequently commenced from
19 April 2021
The Government continued to monitor the international situation to enable timely country risk
assessments. From 3 to 15 May 2021, the Government implemented a high-risk country travel
pause on passengers (including Australian citizens and permanent residents) from India. This was
due to a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in India, with over 3 million each day for several days in
a row. There was a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases detected in international
travelers in quarantine within Australia who had returned from India, threatening to overwhelm local
health resources.

Reopening of Australian borders
Australia’s staged international border reopening commenced on 1 November 2021. This allowed
fully vaccinated Australians to travel overseas without an individual exemption. This aligned with the
Australian population having higher (at or near 80%) vaccination rates nationally.
The emergence of new variants prevented the full reopening of Australia’s international borders. On
28 November 2021, the Government introduced a high-risk country travel pause for select countries
in Africa because of the new Omicron variant. Those who had been in a country of concern in the
14 days prior to their travel were either denied entry (for non-citizens/permanent residents of

Australia) or required to quarantine on arrival. Those already in Australia at the commencement of
the measures were required to immediately self-isolate and be tested for COVID-19.
The Government reopened borders to fully vaccinated eligible visa holders (primarily skilled,
student, family, and humanitarian visas) from 1 December 2021, enabling these cohorts to come to
Australia without a travel exemption. This was extended to all fully vaccinated visa holders from
21 February 2022.

Communication fortravel restrictions
The Department provided a range of communication materials to support the community
understanding travel requirements. For example, the Department provided social media updates
regarding travel requirements, including links to the relevant jurisdictional webpages.
Communication was tailored to meet the varying needs across the community including advice for
people returning to Australia from overseas. Materials were available online, provided to airlines to
adapt for use at overseas departure points and available at Australian entry points. A mix of
targeted advertising, public relations, media engagement and briefing were used as well as tailored
and accessible information for diverse audiences.

 Key Learnings
 In 2021 an audit was conducted by the ANAO on the Management of International Travel
 Restrictions during COVID-1922. The ANAO report noted that the Department’s arrangements for
 implementing and managing travel restrictions were largely effective and well informed by robust
 planning and policy advice. Restricting international travel had proven effective in reducing the
 risk of widespread disease transmission through uncontrolled importation of cases.
 Considerations in border closures and messaging
 The rapid closure of Australia’s borders was a crucial early decision in the pandemic response.
 This decision helped prevent the significant spread of COVID-19 and Australia’s health system
 becoming overwhelmed. Maximising vaccination coverage prior to reopening the borders enabled
 the health system to prepare and reduced the rates of severe illness from outbreaks.
 There were significant social and economic impacts from the border closures. These included the
 separation of families, financial burden on those who were still required to travel and quarantine,
 and the economic impact on businesses (such as supply chain and workforce challenges).
 Biosecurity considerations in the maritime environment
 The Ruby Princess cruise ship incident highlighted several gaps in Australia’s human biosecurity
 framework in the maritime environment. These were explored through several external reviews,
 namely the Inspector-General of Biosecurity review of the Ruby Princess cruise ship incident23,
 and the NSW Special Commission of Inquiry into the Ruby Princess24. Work is ongoing within
 both the Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF), to
 implement the recommendations from these reviews. Some legislative changes to the Biosecurity
 Act’s subordinate legislation were made in 2023.
 These changes include requiring all cruise ships arriving in Australia to arrive in negative pratique
 (requiring manual permission to disembark passengers) and clarifying the pre-arrival reporting
 process and timeframes for all incoming vessels to Australia.
 Any changes to future mechanisms need to be workable during uncertain and dynamic
 times. Some elements of the Biosecurity Act, such as the Human Biosecurity Control Orders

 (HBCO), were not used because they were administratively impractical compared to other
 available measures in federal and state/territory legislation.
 The HBCO could be reviewed to make them more deployable in situations such as with very high
 numbers of cases as seen in the Ruby Princess scenario. Other changes such as cruise ships
 now being in negative pratique combined with other existing federal and jurisdiction-level powers,
 have to some extent mitigated these concerns. On balance, reforms to the HBCO framework is
 not priority for legislative change at this time.

       5.2.      Travel requirements - masks, screening pre-departure testing,
              vaccination and declarations
Travel restrictions
In conjunction with measures and travel restrictions to respond to the spread of COVID-19 globally,
several other actions were taken by the Government and Department to protect Australia. Including:
   •    Enhanced border measures and communications to keep travellers aware of changes to
        travel requirements,
   •        Enhanced health screening,
   •        Mask wearing and predeparture testing, and
   •        Travel declarations.
Further detail is at Attachment 7.

 Key Learnings
 The substantive provisions of the Biosecurity Act commenced in June 2016, meaning this was the
 first time many of its human health powers had been utilised. While several preparedness
 exercises had been conducted prior to 2020, the breadth of possibilities were not covered in
 those exercises. In particular, the emergency powers had a broader application, and were used to
 implement a greater range of public health and social measures, than foreseen during the pre­
 pandemic considerations and exercises.
 As noted in Section 5.1 - Key Learnings, ensuring the Biosecurity Act is appropriately designed
 and includes powers to respond to a wide range of scenarios could assist in responding to future
 pandemics. Central to any consideration regarding changes to the Biosecurity Act is ensuring
 response mechanisms are proportional to perceived heath threats and the need to balance
 personal liberties.
 Speed of response
 One major strength of Australia’s response was the ability to use emergency determinations
 under s477 of the Biosecurity Act to respond swiftly and effectively to evolving situations. Strong
 legal and policy support in the Department enabled s477 determinations to be signed and
 registered quickly to respond to changing and rapidly emerging events.
 Variability in measures and messaging
A key challenge during the pandemic response was the variability in the measures and
messaging across States and Territories. For example, jurisdictions had varying isolation,
quarantine, and travel requirements during different phases. Similarly, the resumption of cruising
was challenged by vastly different reporting and outbreak management requirements across
jurisdictions.
 While this was often necessary to manage individual jurisdictional contexts and risks, it resulted in
 challenges providing consistent public health messaging, causing confusion and eroding trust. It
 is anticipated the Australian CDC’s establishment will help to address some of these challenges
 by strengthening relationships between the Commonwealth and States and Territories.


                                                                                                       43
    Actions taken by the Department in response to the pandemic learnings
    The Department has incorporated lessons identified from the pandemic to improve border health
    processes. This has included:
    •    revising pre-arrival and ill traveller reporting procedures to give authorities more lead-time for
         preparation and a wider baseline for analysing risk and clarifying situations for
         granting/denying pratique,
    •    strengthening the Biosecurity Act 2015 to provide greater civil penalties to deter non­
         compliance,
    •    improving formal coordination processes between the Department and DAFF, including
         refining information-sharing about potential threats, and
    •    refining communication and coordination protocols between human biosecurity officers, the
         Department and other agencies.
    The Department is also working to implement changes in response to multiple ANAO audits of
    border health arrangements during COVID-19.

          5.3.            International partner engagement on vaccines and treatments
Timely access to COVID-19 vaccines was crucial to Australia achieving high immunisation rates
during the early stages of the pandemic.

Australia’s COVID-19 vaccine purchases
As outlined in Section 3.4, Australia’s investments in vaccines included both sovereign and
international options. This provided the Government with choice and flexibility during vaccine
development uncertainty. This section focuses on our international vaccine efforts.

Supply flexibility due to strong partnerships
Throughout 2021 when the vaccination program was experiencing vaccine shortages, the
Department secured additional vaccines through dose swap arrangements and vaccine purchases
from other countries experiencing a surplus. For example:
Dose swap
•       500,000 doses of Pfizer were provided by Singapore on 31 August 2021 with Australia then
        providing 500,000 doses to Singapore in November 2021, and
•       Four million doses of Pfizer were provided by the United Kingdom (UK) on 3 September 2021
        with Australia then providing four million doses to the UK in November and December 2021.
Surplus purchases
•       One million doses of Pfizer were purchased from the Republic of Poland on 15 August 2021,
        and
•       One million doses of Moderna were purchased from European Union member states on
        3 September 2021.

International donations
Australia donated more than 52 million doses to countries in the Indo Pacific and Southeast Asia,
including:
•       23.6 million doses as part of our commitment to share 40 million doses through the
        Department’s procured supply, and
•       28.5 million doses as part of the commitment to share 20 million doses through DFAT’s
        agreement with UNICEF.
                                                                                                              44
Following the establishment of a separate donation framework with the COVAX Facility, Australia
offered a further 16.8 million doses for distribution to participating developed and developing
countries. Included in this, 16,000 doses to Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Indemnity for vaccine manufacturers
Indemnities were provided to COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers covering certain liabilities that could
result from the use of their vaccine25. This was not unique in a global context, with indemnities a
common element of agreements with vaccine manufacturers internationally.
If the Government did not provide certain indemnities to vaccine manufacturers, there would have
been significant delays in securing commitments to supply or even a refusal from manufacturers to
supply vaccines in Australia.
The COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme was established to maintain public confidence and
provides support where a person suffered moderate to significant harm following the administration
of a COVID-19 vaccine. The Scheme is scheduled to end on 30 September 2024.
       5.4.                COVID-19 Deployments
The National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre (NCCTRC) is a key component of the
Government’s disaster and emergency medical preparedness and response capability to incidents
of local, national and international significance. The NT Government receives funding from the
Government to ensure the NCCTRC’s has 24/7 health disaster response capabilities.
The NCCTRC provides trauma response services and surge workforce capacity to the Royal
Darwin Hospital and national training and coordination of personnel registered to deploy with
AUSMAT. AUSMAT team members are drawn from all State and Territories.
Between February 2020 and April 2022, the AUSMAT undertook 22 COVID-19 related missions; 10
domestic missions and 12 international missions (see Attachment 8). In addition to deployments,
the NCCTRC supported the Tokyo Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in 2021, the Beijing
Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympic Games in 2022 and supported quarantine services at the
Centre for National Resilience (see Section 3.6).

 Key Learnings
 During the Omicron outbreak in late 2021 and early 2022, Australia’s domestic public health
 response constrained the availability of AUSMAT personnel. AUSMAT was able to respond to
 every requested mission over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, however personnel
 constraint impacts on AUSMAT capacity should be considered for the future.
 An independent review of Australian Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) capabilities
 commissioned by the Minister for Health and Aged Care in 2023 provided several findings on how
 to support current and future EMT capability (nationally and internationally). These findings are
 being used to support the further development and refinement of Australia’s existing EMT
 capabilities including strengthening the domestic deployment capabilities of AUSMAT.

       5.5.                International engagement
The Department engaged with other countries facing similar experiences with COVID-19 vaccine
programs such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This provided an opportunity to share
learnings about the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine programs and other activities

occurring internationally. The Department also participated in regular forums initiated by the COVAX
Facility.
The TGA collaborated with international regulators leveraging information received from the:
      -      Australia-Canada-Singapore-Switzerland-United Kingdom (Access) Consortium,
      -      European Medicines Agency OPEN initiative,
      -      United States Food and Drug Administration,
      -      Medsafe, (New Zealand), and
      -      International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities.
The TGA was one of four regulators invited by the European Union to take part in their vaccine
evaluation meetings. This enabled detailed discussions on the safety, efficacy and quality of
vaccines with one of the world’s major regulators.
To support surveillance efforts, the CMO held regular, informal discussions with counterparts from
Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States. These discussions allowed sharing
of technical and policy details to improve the understanding of challenges. The group continues to
meet to discuss public health approaches to COVID-19 and emerging threats including approaches
to seasonal flu.

    Key Learnings
    Engagement through strong international connections can facilitate early access of information on
    emerging infectious health threats. Working closely with global partners to manage threats helps
    enable early and informed decision making on domestic responses. It also guides global and
    regional responses and informs targeted support Australia can offer its neighbours.
    Further, Australia is actively engaged in two separate but linked negotiations. The development of
    a new international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (pandemic
    treaty) and amend the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR). A strong global health system
    is critical for improving the detection and prevention of infectious disease outbreaks.
    The new Health Security Unit in the Interim Australian CDC will look to harness these
    opportunities and strengthen Australia’s health protection framework.



Relevant Term(s) of Reference: Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs
of particular populations (including across genders, age groups, socio-economic status,
geographic location, people with disability, First Nations peoples and communities and
people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities).


     6.   Preparation and readiness for future responses
This section will cover:
Details of mechanisms implemented or planned to improve future emergency responses, not
otherwise noted in prior sections, including:
•     6.1 - Evidence based decision making
•     6.2 - Key data assets, systems and capability
•     6.3 - Aged Care
•     6.4 - First Nations, Disability and CALD




                                                                                                    46
           6.1.                  Evidence based decision making
The COVID-19 pandemic required a rapid and adaptable response from the Government. It was
important to have as much research, data and information available to enable evidence-based
decisions.
The Department required additional capabilities and capacity to meet the speed and scale of the
pandemic. For example, the Department commissioned several modelling pieces from the
University of Melbourne (UoM), including the Doherty Institute, to inform policy on public health and
social measures. The UoM’s Situational Assessment of COVID-19 in Australia reports26 used
epidemiological data to model health service presentations and the impact of interventions.
Establishing a better understanding of COVID-19 was an immediate priority given it was a novel
disease. The Department acted quickly to announce the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF)
Coronavirus Research Response on 11 March 2020. Three priority areas for investment were
identified:
     -             vaccine development,
     -             treatment development, and
     -             other COVID-19 specific respiratory medicines research.
The MRFF has supported 85 projects across 29 grant opportunities. The National Health and
Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has supported 44 research projects. Several projects
supported through the MRFF have contributed to evidence-based decision making and provided
insights into future emergency pandemic responses including capacity development. Key projects
are described in Attachment 9.
Decision-making processes of expert committees, such as the AHPPC and its sub-committees also
made significant contributions, providing decision makers with the most accurate and timely clinical
advice available at the time.
 A research prioritisation framework will be developed as part of the establishment of the Australian
CDC to facilitate rapid public health research in response to emerging infectious diseases. This
framework will leverage existing funding mechanisms, including the MRFF and NHMRC, to explore
ways to reduce red tape and improve the timeliness of approval and disbursement processes.
           6.2.                  Key data assets, systems and capability
The value of data linkage work extends beyond COVID-19 into many other settings, including other
infectious diseases and chronic conditions. A clear learning from the pandemic is the need for a
national interoperable surveillance system with inputs from other data sources. This will allow
improved monitoring capability, understanding of disease trends, and inform how government
investments can be targeted most effectively.
The Government, in partnership with States and Territories, made significant improvements to
Australia’s data capabilities during the pandemic. This included:
•    establishing track and trace capability for COVID-19 vaccines,
•    weekly linking of AIR, MBS, and PBS data into the Person Linked Integrated Data Asset. In
     addition, there was the rapid linkage of population level data by creating a national single
     COVID-19 database, the COVID-19 Register. A national dashboard of ICU activity, the Critical
     Health Resources Information System was also developed,
•    establishing strong data sharing relationships with jurisdictions, other departments and providers
     underpinned the timely integration of data, and

                                                                                                                                   47
•   developing internal capability and relationships to produce robust research and evidence which
    uses complex linked datasets.
Bolstering data capabilities and maintaining investments in data systems will remain a key part of
Australia’s pandemic preparedness. In particular there are opportunities to incorporate national
hospitalisations and case data to provide a quantitative indicator of case severity in addition to
mortality data.
There are further opportunities in relation to national disease surveillance. The National Notifiable
Disease Surveillance System (NINDSS) is the core data system used for national COVID-19
surveillance. The NINDSS coordinates national surveillance of communicable diseases through
daily reports from jurisdictions. The NINDSS is case-based, not person-based, and it is not possible
to link case information to personal information in other health and social datasets to further analyse
at-risk populations.
System deficiencies further reduced the Department’s ability to coordinate national response
activities. Ad-hoc data systems were developed to address these deficiencies however these
interim solutions often result in policies and products being developed based on data sourced from
a range of different systems.
      6.3.           Workforce
The pandemic exacerbated existing challenges faced by the health and aged care workforce. The
Department worked with other agencies and governments to facilitate movement of health and aged
care workers. This included support for short term exemptions to work restrictions for international
medical and nursing students and introducing additional flexibilities to workforce programs. Despite
these efforts, challenges remained.
Domestic and international travel restrictions and the associated costs with quarantine compounded
challenges in attracting overseas trained workforce, and movement of other essential health and
aged care workforces such as AUSMAT.
As a result, the Visas for GPs Program saw a 30% reduction in the number of Health Workforce
Certificates issued for overseas doctors in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20.
In 2020, changes to the AHPRA sub-register made up to 26,000 practitioners eligible to practice
once again. However, surveys indicated only 8% of these practitioners returned to the workforce.
To provide greater flexibility to health professionals, the locum tenens period was extended from
two weeks to twelve weeks. The extension was a temporary change to support the COVID-19
response, reducing the number of Medicare provider number applications and allowing faster
processing of applications for health professionals.
As discussed in Section 4.4, as part of the Private Hospital Viability Guarantee, the Government
and jurisdictions partnered with the private hospital sector to utilise the 30,000 hospital beds, and
the sector’s 105,000 skilled workforce across 657 private and not-for-profit hospitals.
While the private hospital capacity was useful as part of the Victorian aged care response in 2020, it
quickly became apparent that the workforce serving private hospitals was not a dedicated
workforce. Much of the 105,000 headcount was also engaged in aged care and public hospital
settings, meaning it was not able to be redeployed in the public hospital and aged care sectors.
The vaccination rollout was a substantial effort and required a redistribution of resources and
workforce to ensure the timely and effective delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to Australians. This
redistribution may have impacted capacity in other parts of the health system.
      6.4.           Aged care future state preparedness and response
Since the delivery of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety Final Report, the
Government has invested more than $30 billion in additional funding into the aged care system.



                                                                                                        48
The Government’s reform agenda for aged care also aims to ensure that older people in Australia
are prioritised and there are continued improvements in quality, safety and choice. This is being
achieved through a suite of reforms, including:
  •     Workforce support for upskilling and furloughing of staff,
  •     support for facilities to address the direct additional costs,
  •     introducing star ratings to make informed choices,
  •     funding a 15% wage rise for more than 250,000 aged care workers,
  •     face-to-face support in Services Australia service centers, and
  •     expanding the National Aged Care Mandatory Quality Indicator Program.
These reforms complement the continued focus on recovery and maintenance of the aged care
sector’s response capability and preparedness for any future pandemics. The Department continues
to support aged care providers to build their capability and capacity by:
  •   providing on-going financial assistance that supports the planning for and management of
      outbreaks, including COVID-19 and other infectious diseases,
  •   Supporting continued surge workforce for RACHs impacted by an outbreak and experiencing
      staff shortages, and
  •   On-going access to IPC resources and online training material, surveillance and monitoring
      activities and research into existing IPC processes.
      6.5.           Supporting people from First Nations communities
Early in the pandemic the Government acknowledged that First Nations peoples were likely to be
disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. This led the Department implementing measures to
support First Nations communities that complemented and aligned with the priority reforms of the
National Agreement on Closing the Gap, in close partnership with First Nations stakeholders.
First Nations emergency responses measures were developed through partnership and planning at
the local level. A COVID-19 Advisory Group, jointly chaired by the Department and the NACCHO,
brought together expert medical and First Nations representatives to strengthen First Nations voices
on COVID-19 issues. The Advisory Group formally transitioned in 2023 to the National Aboriginal
Torres Strait Islander Health Protection sub-committee (NATSIHP), a sub-committee of the AHPPC.
ACCHOs were essential in the COVID-19 response. Funding was provided to the ACCHO sector to
implement COVID-19 responses that were bespoke and tailored to the local community. The
Government worked with the sector to provide flexible funding to ensure suitability for local
communities with diverse needs. This ensured fit for purpose communication, support and advice
for First Nations people.
Since 1 January 2023, the Government has been transitioning the COVID-19 response to normal
health service delivery arrangements. The Department is continuing to work in partnership with the
NACCHO, NATSIHP, ACCHOs and communities to implement measures to increase vaccination
uptake and promote community-led, targeted and local COVID-19 responses for First Nations
people.
      6.6.           People with Disability
People with disability experienced profound challenges throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. These
included difficulties accessing disability supports, health services and information to help them
navigate the health emergency. Some people with disability continue to isolate themselves from the
community to avoid risk of exposing themselves to COVID-19.
Australian data indicates people with disability, as a population, are at higher risk of severe disease
and death due to COVID-19 than the general population. This is likely due in part to the increased

                                                                                                     49
prevalence of complex underlying health conditions amongst this group. Other factors may also
contribute to this risk, including inequitable access to health services.
The Government and State and Territory Governments encountered several challenges in
responding to the COVID-19 health emergency for people with disability, including:
•   communicating effectively and efficiently with people with disability (with diverse communication
    needs), their families and the disability support workforce,
•   delivering appropriate adjustments to ensure people with disability can access testing and
    vaccination services,
•   preventing and supporting the management of outbreaks in disability residential services
    operating with a casualised workforce with no or limited clinical staff, and
•   overcoming data limitations to obtain information on vaccination rates and the impact of the
    pandemic on people with disability (e.g. data on COVID-19 mortality rates among people with
    disability).
Some key learnings27 observed throughout the pandemic include:
•   The impacts of COVID-19 on people with disability have been profound but varied reflecting the
    diversity of health and support needs among this population,
•   Systemic efforts to engage people with lived experience early in the design of the emergency
    responses will help to ensure responses are appropriately informed from the beginning,
•   Community-informed responses to engaging and communicating with people with disability will
    help enable more effective engagement and better dissemination of information,
•   Communication of health advice to people with disability must be tailored, directed through the
    right channels to help it reach target groups quickly, and in an appropriate format to be
    accessed and understood,
•   Addressing data gaps and better data capture will support more informed health responses, and
•   Clear governance arrangements between Government health and disability agencies at the
    federal and jurisdictional levels will enable better future health emergency responses.
Collaboration between relevant areas of the Department, Government agencies, State and Territory
health and disability agencies and the disability community were pivotal in shaping emergency
response measures for people with disability. This collaboration improved throughout the pandemic.
Groups like the Advisory Committee on the Health Emergency Response to COVID-19 for People
with Disability established in April 2020 and the Disability and Health Sector Consultation
Committee in April 2021 were central to the improved collaboration.
       6.7.        Supporting people from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse
                    communities
Experience of the COVID-19 pandemic showed diverse and tailored responses are required to
effectively engage with everyone in Australia. According to the ABS 2021 Census, over half of the
Australian population were born overseas or have one parent born overseas. Over 350 different
languages are spoken in homes in Australia and almost a quarter of households use a language
other than English.




27 These reflect learnings from the Advisory Committee captured in the ‘Lessons Learned During the COVID-19 Pandemic' report,
accessible via: http 7www.healfh.gov.au/resources/pubiications/iessons-learned-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-advison/-committee-on-
the-health-emergency-response-to-covid-19-for-people-with-disability .



                                                                                                                                50
Prior to 2020, the Department’s communication with people from CALD backgrounds was limited. It
was done by translating existing assets and engaging media outlets such as SBS and large-scale
ethnic press. Lack of specialised skills and limited capacity meant the most populous groups were
targeted more frequently. COVID-19 revealed health system weaknesses, and barriers these
groups faced accessing information and health care.
While translated materials were important to ensure CALD communities had access to information,
79% of Australian CALD populations surveyed in 2023 prefer to receive their health information in
plain English and 84% prefer audio-visual resources. Opportunities for people to have in-language
and culturally safe conversations with people they trust, where they feel confident to ask questions,
are also very effective in helping people overcome barriers to access. Intermediaries (community
leaders/trusted messengers) are gateways to genuine engagement and communication within
CALD communities.
From December 2022, the Department established a dedicated Multicultural Health Section to lead
a coordinated approach and ensure policies and programs across the portfolio consider are
culturally safe and responsive to the needs of multicultural communities in their design and
implementation.
      6.8.           Communication with diverse groups
Three key groups - the CALD Communities COVID-19 Health Advisory Group, the First Nations
Health Advisory Group, and the Disability Working Group - played essential roles in the
Government’s communication response to COVID-19. They provided pathways to build trust with
diverse communities and their lived experience helped to improve processes, enhancing community
access and understanding of issues.
Their advice has led to lasting improvements.
The ongoing advice and scrutiny provided by these groups has led the Department to reflect on its
engagement with diverse groups and explore ways to improve this capability.
