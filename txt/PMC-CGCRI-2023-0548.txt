The overall Australian approach to Covid was one of over-reaction and over-reach.
Rather than simply protecting the vulnerable (aged, infirm), healthy people were
often ‘locked up’ for no major reason with numerous negative financial, social and
mental health consequences.
To put it bluntly, it was absurd to cancel attendance at major sporting events at the
last moment due to several Covid cases or shut-down state borders due to a Covid
breakout. It was tragic that attendance at funerals were at times limited to just a few
or weddings were celebrated with a handful of people.
Then the mandates pressuring the update of the experimental vaccines were
obscene. It was literally evil compelling young healthy people to take an
experimental vaccine or lose their jobs. And then the healthy unvaccinated banned
from sitting in a restaurant or attending certain entertainment venues was also
absurd bordering on criminal.
Thankfully, common sense prevailed in May 2022 and we could get back on with our
lives as the majority of restrictions were abandoned virtually overnight. However,
many of us unnecessarily lost over two years of our lives.
And when many of us finally got Covid it was no big deal! Look after your body, eat
healthy - and where possible organic - food, exercise and take the appropriate
medicine and you will be alright after a few days. It was just a bad flu!
May it never never never ever happen again where we constrain and lock-up healthy
people - and pressurise healthy people to take an experimental vaccine.
