                      Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry
                                             My Submission
To the Independent Panelists:
I request:
                       Governance (The act of governing; exercising authority)
    •   A thorough examination of the ethics of Emergency Use Authorisation vaccines being bought
        and encouraged to be administered, with financial incentives to doctors, pharmacists, and
        hospitals, aged care facilities, etc., by the Federal Government;
    •   A thorough examination of the coercion that the Federal Government was fully aware of,
        being applied to large numbers of Australians, in order that they keep their employment, be
        able to travel, visit sick or aged loved ones, and so on, and assess this against the principles
        of fully-informed consent as enshrined in The Nuremberg Code for experimental prophylaxis;
    •   A thorough examination of the Federal Government's health authorities' insistence that the
        vaccines were and are safe and effective, in the light of substantial evidence, admitted by the
        likes                and others, that the vaccines neither prevented Covid-19 infection
        nor transmission;
    •   A thorough examination of conflict of interest and competing interest factors among the key
        providers and advisors upon whose advice the Federal Government acted.


                                       Key health response measures
    •   A thorough examination of the almost complete lack of health advice from the Federal
        health authorities for time-honoured effective and safe natural and generic drug prophylaxis
        and treatment protocols (e.g. Ivermectin);
    •   A thorough examination of the Federal health authorities' advice to do nothing unless and
        until Covid-19 infection was advanced enough to endanger health (the only disease in history
        to which this practice has ever been officially advised)
    •   A thorough examination of the Federal health authorities' placing of Covid-19 vaccinations
        into the Childhood Vaccination Schedule, being mindful that the younger cohorts had and
        have minimal serious risk from Covid-19, while serious adverse effects from vaccination
        exceed the benefits (risk vs benefits ratio).


                              Mechanisms to better target future responses
    •   Institute the providing of health prophylaxis and treatment measures that include a full
        range of time-honoured protocols, including natural and generic drug treatments.


                                            International policies
    I urge the panelists' to reject any ceding of pandemic response sovereignty to the WHO or any
    other non-Australian body.
    Please consider advising the Federal Government to conduct a Royal Commission with wide
    terms of reference into Australia's Covid-19 Response.


    Thank you for your consideration of my submission ...
