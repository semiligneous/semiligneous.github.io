Submission - Covid-19 enquiries

Dear Sirs,

I'd urge you to investigate and to never again allow for the removal of our freedoms by governments in the form of
mask mandates, vaccine mandates, lockdowns, and curfews.
Also, we deserve a real COVID inquiry that will investigate all aspects of how the 'pandemic' was handled.

In relation to the scope: - Key health response measures (for example across COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments,
key medical supplies such as personal protective equipment, quarantine facilities, and public health messaging).

It was the first time in the medical history that the government interfered with patient-doctor relationship by
disallowing doctors to prescribe very effective against Covid and very safe medications, despite very quickly growing
massive amounts of evidence supporting the effectiveness of those medications, (please see evidence as indicated
below this text: "Ivermectin for COVID-19: real-time meta-analysis of 99 studies", and "American Journal of
Therapeutics - Ivermectin")


There was no information provided to the public on how to strengthen one's immune system for a better chance of
surviving Covid, although such scientific information was available to the government. (Please see evidence
attachment: "Vitamin D Insufficiency")

Those medications like Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, that saved thousands of lives were officially banned in
Australia - a criminal act by the government.
Infected were told to do nothing and wait until they were unable to breath at which point, they were told to call an
ambulance.
Never ever before in medical history doctors were prevented from trying to cure or at least to lessen the effects of
any illness. The only solution allowed for them was the so called "vaccines" that were not a cure at all and not a
prevention either.

The "vaccines" which are in fact gene therapies have very quickly demonstrated that they do not stop infections or
transmission of the virus, yet there was a very heavy push from all the government bodies to "vaccinate" as many
people as possible. Billions of taxpayers' dollars were spent on useless and dangerous "vaccines".

The Nuremberg Code was violated with coercing people to take the experimental injections that had no long-term
studies and which already at the first phase of Pfizer studies have demonstrated to be very dangerous, and all while
there are adequate, approved and available alternatives to the vaccines. (Please see evidence beSlow this text: 5.3.6
CUMULATIVE ANALYSIS OF POST-AUTHORIZATION ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS OF PF-07302048 (BNT162B2) RECEIVED
THROUGH 28-FEB-2021 -Table 1 on Page 7 - 1223 fatal cases)


All push for the experimental vaccination was in full swing while there was already an extremely large scientific date
available proving that the so called "Covid-19 vaccines" are very dangerous, (please see evidence in attachment:
"750+ Studies About the Dangers of the COVID-19 Injections", and below this text a page from "Cheltenham Post",
and "Circulation Journal", and attachment "COVID-19 vaccines - An Australian Review")

As a result, many have died unnecessarily, many more have suffered terrible side effects and many more are still
dying since the excess deaths in Australia are still very high and until proven otherwise, cannot be associated with
anything else but the vaccines.

Furthermore, the mandates for masks wearing were completely deprived of any science at all. In fact, the science is
clear that the negative effects of wearing masks are high and that they do not give any protection against viruses.
(Please see evidence attachment: "Physio-metabolic and clinical consequences of wearing face masks—Systematic
review with meta-analysis and comprehensive
Evaluation")

It is time to bring the guilty to justice.

   Conclusions:
   Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of
   ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant
   reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral
   clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis
  trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the
   regular use of ivermectin. Finally, the many examples of ivermectin
   distribution campaigns leading to rapid population-wide decreases in
   morbidity and mortality indicate that an oral agent effective in all phases
   of COVID-19 has been identified.
  There are NO long-term studies on the effects of the Covid vaccine,
    so your reports are vital for the future vaccine safety of others.

                            Abstract
                            Our group has been using the PLUS Cardiac Test (GD Biosciences, Inc, Irvine, CA) a clinically validated measurement
                            of multiple protein biomarkers which generates a score predicting the 5 yr risk (percentage chance) of a new Acute
                            Coronary Syndrome (ACS). The score is based on changes from the norm of multiple protein biomarkers including
                            IL-16, a proinflammatory cytokine, soluble Fas, an inducer of apoptosis, and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)which
                            serves as a marker for chemotaxis of T-cells into epithelium and cardiac tissue, among other markers. Elevation above
                            the norm increases the PULS score, while decreases below the norm lowers the PULS score The score has been
                            measured every 3-6 months in our patient population for 8 years Recently, with the advent of the mRNA COVID 19
                            vaccines (vac) by Moderna and Pfizer, dramatic changes in the PULS score became apparent in most patients.This
                            report summarizes those results. A total of 566 pts, aged 28 to 97, M F ratio 1:1 seen in a preventive cardiology practice
                            had a new PULS test drawn from 2 to 10 weeks following the 2nd COVID shot and was compared to the previous PULS
                            score drawn 3 to 5 months previously pre- shot Baseline IL-16 increased from 35=/-20 above the norm to 82 =/- 75
                            above the norm post-vac, sFas increased from 22+/-15 above the norm to 46=/-24 above the norm post-vac; HGF
                            increased from 42+/-12 above the norm to 86+/-31 above the norm post-vac These changes resulted in an increase of
                            the PULS score from 11 % 5 yr ACS risk to 25% 5 yr ACS risk. At the time of this report, these changes persist for at
                            least 2.5 months post second dose of vac.We conclude that the mRNA vacs dramatically increase inflammation on the
                            endothelium and T cell infiltration of cardiac muscle and may account for the observations of increased thrombosis,
                            cardiomyopathy, and other vascular events following vaccination
