Dear Dr
It has come to my attention that our government is planning to approve changes with the
World Health Organistions International health regulations.


that mean we will:


Permanently lose our right to make decisions about our own life and the life of our loved
ones.
Have decisions about our children's welfare and health made by unelected bureaucrats, not
us!
No longer be entitled to basic human rights, fundamental freedoms and free speech.
Be forced to take whatever medical procedure is prescribed, not by our doctor, but by
overseas bureaucrats!!


If the government supports this absurdity, it would mean Loss of bodily autonomy, loss of
human rights, FEAR for the health of me and my family, loss of democracy and
independence, loss of Australians to being answerable to, and making the best decisions for
Australians, stress due to these power Is covering climate mitigation and animals, stress due
to increased cost of living.


I strongly oppose anyone supporting this proposal by WHO


I would like Australia to exit the WHO and the UN.


Take this seriously, most Australians will and I look forward to hearing a personal written
response from you within 21 days to



Regards,




                                           Page 1/2
