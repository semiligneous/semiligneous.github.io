Hi,

My name is Jaime Kerr, a Chinese medicine practitioner.

The Covid vaccine mandate was an absolute overreach by the government. People have lost their
jobs and their health as a result of this coercive medical experiment without full informed consent.
It's a massive infringement on human rights. Many still suffer from the adverse side effects and
some have died. It is unconscionable for the government to refuse to have a royal commission
into the Covid response. I urge the government to do the right thing immediately.

I urge the government to look into the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding the massive
number of excess deaths since the beginning of the roll out of the Covid vaccine.

I urge the government to look into the NSW Department of Health data in 2022 where for months,
the vast majority (many times 100%) of Covid patients who ended up in hospital have been
vaccinated. The higher the number of vaccines, the higher the number of hospitalised patients
with Covid.

Thank you for your attention.

Kind regards,
Jaime Kerr
