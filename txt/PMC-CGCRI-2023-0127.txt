To the Panel of the COVID-19 Response Inquiry,



As the                          a                                               and with a deep interest
in mental health, I am compelled to contribute to this inquiry. My unique position has provided me
insight into the multifaceted impact of the pandemic, particularly regarding the government's
response.

Our company experienced significant operational disruptions, financial strain, and a marked decline
in the mental well-being of our staff due to these issues. The lack of clear communication and
perceived ethical lapses in decision-making processes have compounded these difficulties.

The pandemic has highlighted several areas where transparency, ethical practices, and effective
communication were critically needed but often lacked. This submission requests a thorough Royal
Commission investigation into the following:



    •    Corrupt Vaccine Procurement and Secret Contracts: Transparency in vaccine procurement
         processes and the public availability of contract details.
    •    Mask and Vaccine Mandates: Evaluation of the necessity, effectiveness, and impact of
         mandates on individual rights and businesses.
    •    Lockdowns: Analysis of decision-making processes and the socio-economic impacts of
         lockdowns.
    •    Misinformation in Media and Public Statements: Investigation into alleged misinformation
         about vaccine efficacy, especially regarding transmission.
    •    Vaccine Injuries and Reporting: Adequacy of mechanisms for reporting and addressing
         vaccine-related injuries.
    •    Media Censorship and Silencing of Healthcare Professionals: Examination of media practices
         and the alleged silencing of dissenting medical opinions.
    •    Role of AHPRA and ATAGI: Scrutiny of these bodies in the censorship and alleged oppression
         of healthcare professionals.
    •    Treatment of Victims: Addressing the needs and concerns of those adversely affected by the
         pandemic response.



Recommendations:

    •    Transparent and Ethical Governance: Ensure all future contracts and mandates are
         transparent and ethically formulated.
    •    Mental Health Support: Establish comprehensive mental health support for businesses and
         individuals affected by government mandates and misinformation.
    •    Improved Communication and Accountability: Enhance government communication clarity
         and accountability in public health messaging and media interactions.

The scope of these concerns demands a Royal Commission to ensure a thorough and unbiased
investigation. It is crucial for the well-being of our society and the integrity of our governance that
these issues are addressed comprehensively.



Sincerely,
