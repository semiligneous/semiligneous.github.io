Hello and thank you for
the opportunity to
contribute to this inquiry.
Being forced to take a
vaccine in order to work
was an overreach of
powers by government,
especially for a disease
that had a 1% death rate.
The information given to
doctors that
hydroxychloroquine and
Ivermectin were
dangerous untested drugs
was false-evidence was at
the time that they were
beneficial and a meta
analysis subsequently
proveid this to be so.
Government should not lie
to control the behaviour
of doctors.
