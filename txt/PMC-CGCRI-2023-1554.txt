To whom it may concern
  This is my submission on how the government's handling of the covid situation,has
negatively impacted my life.
  My grandson was a vibrant, active, happy and healthy 10 year old. He loved playing sport
of many kinds.
   His mother (My daughter), believing the vaccination was safe and affective and had my
grandson vaccinated.
  Since the vaccination my grandsons health deteriorated, his mother took him to the doctor
and it was determined that he has pericarditis.
   Going through the peer reviewed medical data that is now becoming widely available,it is
now highly likely that the covid vaccine has some extremely negative side effects.
  The government has been remiss in it's duty of care to the Australian people. If my
daughter had known the dangerous side effects of the covid vaccine,she never would have
had her son receive the vaccination.
