The federal government was responsible for the international border closure, travel restrictions
imposed on Australian citizens and permanent residents as well as quotas on international airlines.

It was state and territory governments that imposed lockdowns, prevented people from travelling
within Australia, stopped them from running their businesses and earning and living and ordered the
police to use force to ensure compliance with these draconian measures.

It was they who closed schools, against expert advice, made life a living^^for people in nursing
homes and allowed the sick to die alone denying them the right to be with their loved ones.

As we have seen, the MrNA vaccines did not stop people form getting Covid or from spreading it.
This was contrary to the propaganda pushed by pharmaceutical companies and their puppets
working in the TGA and ATAGI. We are now seeing the adverse effects of the Covid vaccines. These
"public servants" lied. Politicians lied. It was obvious to anyone with a brain that rushing through
"emergency approval" for vaccines that had not been tested properly - that had raised serious
questions during trials - would have the potential to cause serious harm. What was the agenda?

The "National Cabinet" was illegitimate from the start and a joke. More theatre from government
for the ill-informed masses. What a joke. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

Any inquiry that leaves the disgraceful actions of states and territories out of its scope is unlikely to
find much favour in public conscience.
