Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry



To the Members of the Independent Panel,



I am writing this submission to voice concerns over certain aspects of Australia's response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. While I recognise the importance of the Inquiry's goal to improve pandemic
preparedness, there are critical areas that require thorough scrutiny.



Concerns Over Specific Pandemic Measures



Mask and Vaccine Mandates: The implementation of mask and vaccine mandates had significant
impacts on individual freedoms and social dynamics. These measures, often invasive, warrant a
detailed review to assess their necessity, effectiveness, and proportionality.



Lockdowns and Curfews: The economic, social, and psychological impacts of lockdowns and curfews
have been profound. An evaluation of these measures is essential to understand their long-term
effects on Australian society and whether they were the most appropriate response.



Communication Strategies: It is quite clear that there was an unwarranted use of fear in public health
messaging. It's important to analyse whether such communication strategies were effective or
whether they contributed to unnecessary panic and distress among the public.

It is also of great concern that anyone who spoke against the government view was censored or
threatened with penalties from numerous agencies & the police even though as we have seen now
with the actual data validating the view they were supporting. The freedom to openly discuss &
question all available information & subsequently have the right to make your own informed decision
is a basic human right.
Concerns Over the Composition and Scope of the Inquiry



Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have previously expressed
support for certain pandemic measures raises questions about the objectivity and impartiality of the
Inquiry. Panel members who have expressed support for such measures should recuse themselves.



Exclusion of Unilateral State and Territory Government Decisions: One of the most significant
omissions in the Inquiry's scope is the exclusion of actions taken unilaterally by state and territory
governments. These decisions, including state-imposed lockdowns and border controls, were pivotal
to the nation's pandemic response and should be included in the Inquiry.



The Need for a Comprehensive Review



While the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry are extensive, it is crucial that the above-mentioned
areas are not overlooked. A truly comprehensive review should encompass all aspects of the
government's response, including those currently outside the Inquiry's scope.



Conclusion



This submission represents a collective call for a more inclusive and thorough investigation into
Australia's COVID-19 response. It also urges for freedom and liberty to not ever be cast aside with
fearmongering as it was by Australian governments during the pandemic. We urge the Inquiry to
consider these points to ensure transparency, accountability, and the safeguarding of Australian
values and liberties.
