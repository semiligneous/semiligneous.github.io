Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Background: I have a science/engineering/economics analytical background, and became
interested in the COVID-19 response in light of: virus origin speculation; rushed government
acceptance of Big Pharma experimental vaccines; inadequate vaccine testing; Big Tech
censoring of vaccine safety concerns; discrimination against residents objecting to
vaccination; and incidence and non-reporting of side effects. Having had^^^^^^^urgery,
I refused to have the unproven mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

Virus origin: the two main hypotheses for its first detection in late 2019 in Wuhan, China
are: exposure to an infected animal or a research laboratory leak. The latter is believed most
likely, according to an official from the US government agency that partly funded research
carried out in the Wuhan laboratory. (1) (2)

COVID vaccine development: Within 6 days of WHO declaring COVID-19 a pandemic on 11
March 2020, Pfizer signed a letter of intent with BioNTech to co-develop a potential COVID-
19 vaccine by the end of the year - breaking the previous development record of four years
for the mumps vaccine in the 1960s. In those early days, it was unclear how the new virus
was transmitted, or how long it would last. (3)

Thanks to the FDA's emergency approval of the untried, new-technology mRNA vaccine
around end 2020, three billion doses were manufactured by end 2021 (4). Surprisingly, if not
irresponsibly, the vaccine manufacturers were granted exemption from product liability
claims.

Australian government response: The first COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations in Australia (5)
were administered on 22 February 2021, without prior testing by the TGA. Governments
mandated virtually universal vaccination. The first recipients, regarded at a higher risk of
COVID-19, included: quarantine and border workers, frontline healthcare workers, and aged
and disability care residents and staff. Vaccine-administering medical practitioners were
granted exemption from liability.

The claims by governments and their agents - unconditionally disseminated by mass media -
- that the mRNA vaccines were safe, would protect people from catching COVID, and
prevent re-transmission,.were proved false eventually. ( 6) (7)

On the other hand, those seriously questioning mRNA vaccine safety were unfairly
discredited or censored, and labelled 'anti-vaxxers'. Well-informed dissenters included
mRNA vaccine technology inventor, Dr Robert Malone, renown US cardiologist Peter
McCullogh, and retired Pfizer scientist Michael Yeadon.

Mandatory government controls were imposed on residents' freedom to move, e.g. federal
restrictions on international travel and quarantine; State restrictions on movement between
regions and/or interstate; State restrictions on freedom of association, size of gatherings,
and draconian controls on family visits, church attendance, and funeral attendance. (8)

The following observations regarding the efficacy, if any, of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines
are pertinent:
. despite the mRNA technology never having been rigorously proved (9) (10) (11) and
despite the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines being supposedly 'developed' in such a short time,
their implementation in 2021 was high risk and should never have been attempted on such
vast scale;

. despite over 90% of the Australian population being vaccinated twice or more, around half
the total population contracted COVID-19;

. despite there being no justifying evidence or logical reasons, the unvaccinated were
discriminated against by being disallowed entry to certain venues, being denied medical
procedures or services, being denied employment, but expected to trust being safe in the
presence of the vaccinated;

 despite the thousands of significant incidences of adverse side effects experienced by those
vaccinated (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17); and despite the failure by the Australian government
(and by other national governments respectively) to explain the significant excesses of total
country deaths in the last two years (18); the Government and its agents continue to
recommend the administering of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines;

Conclusion: In light of the many unknowns regarding mRNA vaccine efficacy, vaccination
side effects, and government-imposed/influenced human rights abuses during the COVID-19
pandemic, it is considered that a Royal Commission be held to inquire into the response of
Federal and State governments.
