From: Christopher McNicol - (Individual)            To: Commonwealth Government Covid 19 Response Inquiry

My background has been in teaching and education for 30 years. Prior to this I working in Public Broadcasting for six years.

This submission aims to provide information to help improve the various response measures for any future pandemic. In
particular, it seeks to identify serious gaps found Australia's response to the Covid 19 pandemic. Given that the Senate is
currently calling for submissions of a broader nature into establishing a Covid 19 Royal Commission, it is relevant to
acknowledge this separate process:

The Commonwealth Government Covid 19 Response Inquiry appears to have set quite narrow parameters, in this context there
is scope for the panel to reach findings which refer certain matters to the Senate process listed above.

Over the duration of the Covid 19 pandemic there has been great controversy over the health measures instigated by the
various Australian governments, and it is noted that unilateral actions of the state governments are outside the jurisdiction of
this review. Nevertheless, the Morrison government took many initiatives in relation to the Covid 19 pandemic. It is with regard
to the health measures, which the Morrison government initiated, that this submission is directed.

There is much evidence that the Federal government failed appallingly to ensure high standards of care with regard to relevant
strategies for the treatment of Covid. Evidence of this massive failure is mounting all the time. The controversy is grounded on
whether or not the Covid vaccines are safe and effective. Government departments to this day still affirm that the vaccines are
safe and effective.

If the panel feels bound to operate off the expertise of the Federal departments such as the TGA, then my submission would be
quickly dismissed. But the modus operand! of the TGA is very much being challenged by this submission.

Please consider carefully the following evidence:

1.                                          Hin the "Journal of Clinical and Experimental Immunology".
                                 have produced a peer reviewed study. It is an Australian study from the University of Queensland.
     This study states: "The mRNA vaccines are neither safe nor effective; but outright dangerous." And: "Never in Vgccine history
     have 57 leading scientists and policy experts released a report questioning the safety and efficacy of a vaccine." See link

2.                            this is another peer reviewed study             16/4/23 presents evidence that Covid injections have
     created 45 times as many deaths from vaccines than all others since 1990. While this peer reviewed study is an American
     study it has direct relevance to the topic within Australia. Here first is an article introducing the study:

4.                            AMPS (Australian Medical Professionals' Society); a new medical union seeking to challenge the AMA, AMPS ar
     gain a significant percent of medical professionals into their membership. The organisation hundred of doctors who are
     members. One of the key factors within this presentation is to ask why have there been so many doctors willing to lose the
     certification to practice medicine rather than endorse government positioning. On December 10th, 2022 there was a
     symposium gathering of approximately 200 people who met to hear six AMPS doctors speak at Angaston Town Hall. Two
     items are listed below. The first is their website; the second is a three hour recording of the events which took place at
     Angaston on 10/12/2022. The lack of safety and efficacy of TGA policies is substantially addressed in the following rumble
     presentation. See^^^^^^^^^^^^^^in the second link below:

5.                     provides a very similar argument to that presented above at the AMPS event, and this is presented in the
     following video to prove that the Pfizer vaccine had virtually no efficacy.
          o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kf5VK0diBY
6.                          Australia Government TGA and DAEN figures (Database of Adverse Effect Notifications) provides the next sourc
     information. The TGA had at one point listed that over 1000 reports of Covid vaccine death, which had been lodged.
     However, only a small number of these were acknowledged by the TGA to have been caused by the vaccine.

     The TGA's DAEN figures have not been as transparent as the American VAERS system. The Australian system uses DAEN for
     adverse events. However, from the TGA Senate committee estimates and TGA reports, there has been no serious attempt
     to undertake medical or clinical investigations to show whether Covid vaccines have significantly contributed to reported
     deaths. The TGA tended to discount nearly all reported deaths based upon a simple mathematical calculation. For the TGA,
     their age calculation appeared to be one of their biggest considerations for dismissing Covid vaccine reported deaths. The
     wording of the TGA's previous communications gives them away. For the TGA, there was a requirement for there to have
     been overwhelming evidence for a Covid vaccine death claim; for it to be upheld. In other words, as far as the TGA was
     concerned, the burden of evidence in accepting deaths required that it outweigh not only all other probabilities; but
     consequently, this also appears to be their standard, which requires that there must not be reasonable doubt of the
     reported death being caused by any other factor. Such a standard of cause is absurdly high; especially in the light of strong
     evidence to the contrary. (See documentation below.) TGA reports and positioning places an extremely high level of trust in
     the claims of the vaccine manufacturers. Their reports are also concerned to defend the governments standard of
     confidence in the manufacturer's products; and to support the claims of vaccine manufacturers. There is clear evidence that
     governments around the world were required to sign agreements in which they waived all liability from the vaccine
     companies. Consequently, the operating protocol of the TGA appears to be that the department assumes that Covid
     vaccines were safe and effective; because it had a vested interest to ward off large amounts of litigation which might
     otherwise come against it.

7.                         The following document is perhaps the most telling against the claims of the TGA. This document is Pfizer's own
     and shows that there were 1,223 vaccine deaths. The document is titled: "Cumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization
     Adverse Event Reports Of PF-07302048 (BNT162B2) Received Through 28-FEB-2021"

     While this Pfizer study is an international one, nevertheless it is relevant because the same vaccine was in use and being
     defended by the TGA. This study by Pfizer covers the first 3 months that Pfizer's Covid 19 vaccine was employed.H




     Additional findings of the Pfizer study were that there had been a total of 42,086 adverse reports. This included a list in the
     order of over 1,800 adverse effects. Here is the link for this document's evidence: https://phmpt.org/document/5-3-6-
     postmarketing-experience-pdf/

8.                           VAERS - Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
     Once again this is a USA reporting system. Given that similar products were used in Australia, provides justification in
     examining this system: (i) given that we are using - in most cases - identical vaccines; and (ii) our TGA system lacked
     transparency. Here is the official link:
          •             https://vaers.hhs.gov/
     OpenVAERS is a private group that has been in operation to provide a public service to make the USA system even more
     transparent. Here is their link:
          •             https://openvaers.com/

     The VAERS and OpenVAERS sites provided some of the best information to the Australian public for those wanting to
     question the media and federal government narrative. Greater detail has since emerged from the American state of Florida
     using VAERS figures. See the next point below.

9.                            As time has progressed, following the pandemic, more and more qualitative information has been emerging ab
     dangers of Covid vaccines. The United States of American is much more divided on the issue of Covid vaccines and their
     dangers than our own nation of Australia. Strong evidence has emerged from Florida. Once again, this information is quoted
     because high levels of the same vaccine products were administered there as well as in Australia. Florida's Governor H

     Surgeon General for Florida.          pas produced some starling evidence from the vaccine adverse event information. (This
     is in sharpest contrast to the way the TGA has operatecHrMustrolia. This information has not been reported by our
     Australian TV broadcasters.) The following link is by^^^^^^^^BThis fifteen minute video is a summary; but it also
     provides all the additional links to the authoritative documents. Florida saw a 1,700% increase in vaccine reported deaths in
      2021; while the percentage increase for vaccines was only 400%. At the same time there was a 4,400% increase in the
      reported rate of serious vaccine injuries. Here is the link:

10.                            At the present time there have been multiple other sources of information emerging about the dangers of the
      vaccines. It is not possible in this short submission to list them all. However, one that has recently emerged is from a New
      Zealand whistle-blower:^^^^^^Hciearly, this information is only relevant because New Zealand used Covid 19 vaccine
      products which were very close to those in Australia. The Pfizer vaccine was extensively used in New Zealand as it was here
      in Australia. This is why this information is relevant to this submission about the Covid vaccines in Australia. If it can be
      shown that the Pfizer vaccine statistics produced high rates of death in New Zealand, then there are compelling reasons to
      ask: Is it possible that similar rates of death have occurred in Australia? Are thei^an^ther indicators that may point to
      higher rates of death and injury in Australia for Covid vaccines? Let's look c ^^^^^^^(evidence, which is in fact New
      Zealand Health Ministry data.

                      the administrator of the New Zealand's Health Ministry data. He sought to inform the New Zealand
      government about alarming rates of death from the Covid 19 vaccines. When New Zealand government officials ignored
      him, he downloaded four million of the 12 million data files, anonymized them and distributed them to the world. He was
      then arrested and is currently out on bail. You can access this data on line. Here is one relevant link:

          https://kirschsubstack.eom/p/data-from-us-medicare-and-the-new

      This above link enables access to the record data set from New Zealand Health - after being anonymized. (If the panel is
      reluctant to examine this material, I would remind the panel that many lives have been saved by the actions of whistle­
      blowers in the past.) If the statistics are correct for New Zealand, these are likely to provide a realistic estimate of the
      negative impact of Covid 19 vaccines for Australia. I have found myself quoting the late^^^^^^B- former Labor Minister
      in the Hawke government. During the period of the Hawke government^^^^^^Hsaid: "If I had to choose between a
      conspiracy and a stuff up; I would choose a stuff up nine times out of ten." Clearly, a stuff up is much easier to prove. In fact,
      if a stuff up is not first observed; conspiracy can never be discovered and proven.

      Presently, large numbers of Australian people remain convinced that the government did the right thing in relation to Covid
      19. There was once a Liberal / Labor consensus. However, now with the Senate vote move to support a Covid 19 Royal
      Commission (see link top of 1st page) this clearly provides evidence that such a consensus no longer exists.

      This submission does not include any points in relation to Australian media and broadcasters handing of information. On the
      whole, Australian media and broadcasters have strongly supported the government narrative concerning Covid 19. (There
      have been some exceptions.) This is a very large topic which needs proper analysis, but such analysis will not be happening
      in this submission. I merely wish to make the observation that never before in our nation's history have we had such
      consensus of media views. The "Trusted News Initiative" consists of the: BBC; Google, Facebook, YouTube, The Washington
      Post, Reuters, Associated Press, AFP, The Financial Times, The European Broadcasting Union, and the Australian
      Broadcasting Corporation, (formerly) Twitter, and one suspects Australian TV networks such as 7, 9,10, and well as SBS. We
      have seen media and broadcasters maintaining a consensus on these matters which has continued until the present time.
      Given that the Senate has called for a Royal Commission, the role of media and broadcasting ought to come under close
      scrutiny. Broadcasters positioning has - up until now - censored public health experts who oppose the official narrative.

      In the context of the evidence presented above, I appeal to you to consider the evidence for serious failures in relation to
      serious monitoring of the Covid vaccines. If the vaccines have killed and injured as many Australians as can be estimated by
      in the various reports listed above, then for this inquiry to reach a finding that supports this position would be a profound
      step forward. While it may be possible for this inquiry to build upon such a finding, it would appear from the terms of
      reference that you are being asked to confirm the values of the government's existing narrative.

      I commend the evidence presented to you here. There has been little joy in presenting this evidence to you. I also anticipate
      that there would no delight for you in having to considering this matter. But the seriousness to the evidence requires it.
      Overwhelmingly, there does appear to be some level of conspiracy relating to these events. But it is not my job to prove
      such matters anymore than it is yours. Before a murder trial, often an inquest proceeds it.
I put to you that one of your tasks is to determine whether Covid 19 vaccines have been killing people in sufficient numbers
to warrant a Royal Commission. If the answer is no; then a Royal Commission is not required; and vice versa.
