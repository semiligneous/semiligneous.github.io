               ibers of the Independent Panel,

I am writing this submission to voice concerns over certain aspects of Australia's
response to the COVI.          andemic. While I recognise the important         le Inquiry's
goal to improve pandemic preparedness, there are critical areas that require thorough
scrutiny. Ultimately, I would ask the panel members to ask this simple question
throughout the process...To what end? Did what our government(s) implemented result
in the betterment of our soa             id what our government(s) implemented stop the
virus? Did what our government(s) implemented truly save lives or have we just made
things worse?


Concerns Over Spech            Bernie.Measures
Mask and Vaccine Mandates: The implementation of mask and vaccine mandates had
significant impacts on individual freedoms and social dynamics. The             asures,
often invasive, warrant a detailed review to assess their necessity, effectiveness, and
proportiona          ; a builder it is worth noting that in order to work remove asbestos
which is compose           articles much larger than the particles that the virus occupied,
o       st u            spirator. 0        st have a solid contact with the face which must
be clean shaven and when one blocks the intake filters no air is able to be drawn in and
the mask attaches to the face more securely with the suction created. T            sks that
we were using under the mandate were useless. They served no purpose. NO ONE
would have used these masks to remove asbestos nor use them in any noxious
environment. As for vaccine mandates, to demand society to be vaccinated using a
technology that is still new and has not been thoroughly vetted or to lose everything is
barbaric and obscene. It was neither safe, nor effective.
     downs and Curfews: The economic, social, and psychological impacts of
lockdowns and curfews have been profound. An evaluation of these measures is
essential to understand their long-term effects on Australian society and whether they
were the most appropriate response.
Communication Strategies: It is quite clear that there was an unwarranted use of fear
in public health messaging. It's important to analyse whether such communication
strategies were effective or whether they contributed to unnecessary panic and
distress among the public.
Concerns Over the Composition.and.Scope of the Inquiry
Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have previously
expressed support for certain pandemic measures raises questions about the
objectivity and impartialh            e Inquiry. Panel members who have expressed support
for such measures should recuse themselves.
Exclusion of Unilateral State and Territory Government Decisions: One of t           st
significant omissions in the Inquiry's scope is the exclusion of actions taken
unilaterally by state and territory governments. These decisions, including state-
imposed lockdowns and border controls, were pivotal to the nation's pandemic
response and should be included in the Inquiry. It is interesting to me that on my
passport
Concerns of the fact the Federal Government did not act as it should have.
Ultimately the Federal Government is responsible for issues that affect all Australians.
Clearly this affected all Australians and as such the States and Territories should not
have had the controls they did

While the Term       Werence for the Inquiry are extensive, it is crucial that the aboveÂ­
mentioned areas are not overlooked. A truly comprehensive review should encompass
all aspects of the government's response, including those currently outside the
Inquiry's scope.


Conclusion

This submission represents a collective call I       ore inclusive and thorough
investigation into Australia's COWL        sponse. It also urges for freedom and liberty
to not ever be cast aside with fearmongering as it was by Australian governments
during the pandemic. We urge the Inquiry to consider these points to ensure
transparency, accountability, and the safeguards        ustralian values and liberties.
