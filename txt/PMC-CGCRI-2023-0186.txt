COVID-19 Inquiry

To whom it may concern,

I feel that the Government is obligated to hold a proper Royal Commission to thoroughly investigate
the response by the Federal Government, National Cabinet, and the various States, to the COVID-19
virus because this was one of the most significant events to happen in Australia, and its
consequences and far reaching effects on people, business and the economy was so extensive.

Also, I believe that the current Government is showing a lack of respect for the Australian public, by
only having an inquiry into the COVID-19 response, and allowing such a limited timeframe for
submissions. This inquiry will appear to be just a deliberate white-wash if the following areas are not
properly investigated and reported on:

     •    Official misinformation - that the COVID-19 trial injections were safe & effective; and the
          deliberate blocking of information by eminently qualified medicals professionals who were
          offering legitimate medical alternatives;
     •    Lies that these trial vaccines would block transmission - spread by both media and
          government;
     •        Mask mandates and the effectiveness or otherwise of these.
     •    Corrupt vaccine procurements, and secret contracts; One might ask "what is being hidden
          from the Australian public"?
     •    The invasion of the confidential doctor to patient relationship when AHPRA & ATAGI gagged
          and censored doctors by threatening them with deregistration if they gave individually
          appropriate advise to their patients that may not have fit the blanket approach of the
          government. This cost lives.
     •    Vaccine injuries that have occurred, and the lack of true compensation for those affected;
          My son was too sick to work for three months after his second vaccine and we still don't
          know the long term damage done to him.
     •    Fundamental Human rights such as bodily autonomy being set aside, along with the right to
          protest; etc.
     •    Role of approval of the trial vaccines by TGA - especially relying solely on FDA approval,
          when FDA relied on Phizer/Moderna trials without their own testing;
     •        Mandates in various states for many industries;
     •        Decisions to implement lockdowns, and their length of time and effects;
     •        The basis of Health directives by the relevant authorities.
     •        Role of police enforcement of those heath directives;
     •        The excess deaths in Australia that have not yet been investigated;

A thorough investigation of all these areas, by nothing less than a royal commission, is essential. The
Australian public deserve some reassurance that the lessons from this era in our nation will be learnt
and implemented to ensure that the 'knock on' devastation (caused by an infection) does not repeat
itself.

Yours sincerely,
