Covid Inquiry submission,

I would like to say Australia should have it's own pandemic response team, not follow WHO or
UN based directives. Also,

   •       Mask mandates were harmful
   •   Experiemental gene therapies being called vaccines and doctors being threatened by
       AHPRA so that they can't give informed consent
   •   The government and media encouraging hate and fear of fellow Austalians who were not
       masked or not injected with the experimemtal gene therapy ( A young woman saw me
       w8th9ut a mask on and called the police. The police came and they listened when I said
       I had an exemption, but The Police shouod never have their time wasted on such
       things...almost 4 years in and I never got covld or a cokd symptom )
   •   Inquiry into the science proving Asymptomatic is common enough to warrant any
       measure at all
   •       Violations of the Nuremberg Code
   •       Violations of a person's inalienable right to travel
   •   Psychological harrassment in the form of coercion into getting experimemtal medical
       procedure by government and media
   •       The ongoing excess mortality caused by the experimental medical procdures

Thank you
