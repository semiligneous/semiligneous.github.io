There needs to be an investigation into the conduct of government sponsored media, as well as
Federal and State politicians pushing fear on Australians.

This fear mongering was used to convince the public to get vaccinated with a Gene Therapy that was
only provisionally approved.

I was stood down and ultimately lost my job because I had concerns about the safety of the Covid
Vaccine. I estimate the personal financial loss of wages in excess of $80k.

We need to make sure that peoples individual rights are respected during emergencies. And that
people have the right to medical self determination without penalty, without running the risk of
financial ruin.

The investigation needs to cover the conduct of State Premiers at this time. We also need to know
exactly what the agencies. TGA et al knew. And what was just assumption based on reporting from
international agencies and Pharmaceutical companies.

We need to look at funding and how funding has affected the direction of the Covid Response.

What happened during Covid in WA in terms of mask and vaccine mandates, lockdowns and was the
most tyrannical over reach of government power I have seen in my lifetime.

This inquiry is so narrow in scope and lacks the power to hold the relevant parties accountable in a
meaningful way.
