Submission to the Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry

15/12/2023

Dear Submission Committee Members,

I thank you for the opportunity to provide a submission to the Commonwealth Government Covid-
19 Response Inquiry.

As a mother, wife, friend, and professional health practitioner of 35 years (now retired), I would like to
make a submission based on a simple request.

I would like to express concern over the limited scope of the inquiry and request that a more thorough
inquiry be conducted that encompasses all aspects of state and federal government responses.

I would like to suggest that you consider a thorough investigation as to why the Commonwealth
Government allowed state premiers to implement pandemic response measures that were not based
on science, breached human rights and basic laws of common sense.

Again, I thank you for inviting submissions and hope that you will consider this request.

Yours Sincerely,
