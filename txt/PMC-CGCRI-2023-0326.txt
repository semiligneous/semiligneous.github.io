                   covid enquiry submission

I am seriously concerned that the public have been given only one week to make
submissions to this enquiry. The covid response by governments particularly the Victorian
government has been disastrous, with thousands now dead, injured or unable to work, our
economies in tatters, and small businesses decimated, due to misinformation and
government propaganda. AHPRA and ATAGI have been reprehensible in their response
and must be thoroughly investigated and held to account.

This short response timeframe by the current Australian government is clearly deliberate
as this inquiry is most likely intended to be a complete whitewash.

I strongly request a full Royal Commission for a proper investigation into:
1. Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts

2. Vaccine mandates;

3. Vaccine injuries;

4. Mask mandates and lockdowns;

5. Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
infection and transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gaslighting of the
injured;

6. The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable harm of the
vaccine and their action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical Profession.

Who decided to do the opposite of the 2019 Australian Health Management Plan for
Pandemic Influenza, which prophetically described why all of the actions the Government
did take would not work and would cause hardship?

We need answers, not a whitewash.

We were impacted the most by losing employment due to mandates for vaccination (that
were proven to be dangerous, and clearly caused death and disability to friends and
associates).
