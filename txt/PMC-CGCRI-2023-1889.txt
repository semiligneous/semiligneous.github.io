Dear Sir/Madam,



My submission will directly relate to the "Key Health Response Measures" element of the Terms of
Reference for the Covid-19 Inquiry.

My Experience:

As an experienced Senior Mathematics Teacher                                I am disgusted with the
Australian Government's one-sided handling of the pandemic. The distortion, cherry-picking and
outright misinformation peddled by the Australian Government through the media in relation to
Covid-19 statistics during the Pandemic created an overwhelming sense of fear in the community
and the students that I taught.

I spent many days trying to calm the waves of fear that were being thrust upon my students by a
panicked political/bureaucratic class that failed to inform the public of simple statistics that were
widely available such as the median death age and infection fatality ratio of non-elderly citizens.
According to recent analyses of seroprevalence studies for 31 countries by (Pezzulo, 2022), the
median infection/fatality rate in the pre-vaccination era for under 19-year-olds is estimated at
0.0003% and at a global level, as low as 0.35% for the 0-59 year age group. These are the sorts of
statistics the Federal Government was NOT reporting through their daily press conferences when
issuing statements demanding vaccine compliance with a rushed product that did not prevent
infection or transmission.

The unscientific approach that was followed needs an in-depth investigation and I believe that
nothing less than a Royal Commission is required to fully investigate the wrongdoings of a range of
Politicians and Bureaucrats who made decisions which severely impacted Australian Society and was
a vast overreach of power and abuse of basic human rights, informed consent and squelching of
legitimate scientific debate.



1: Why did the Australian Government purchase over 250 million doses of vaccines in the original
purchases with each of the four manufacturers. This was enough to double dose every Australian
almost ten times when the "Health Experts" assured everyone that two doses were enough. As of
late June, 2022, only a quarter of these doses has been used and will likely expire out of date.
(ABCNews, 2022)

2: Why has ATAGI continued to approve subsequent booster doses based on short studies involving a
small number of mice alone whilst not requiring the vaccine manufacturers to do the proper postÂ­
marketing follow-up studies?

3: Why have the vaccine purchase agreements between the Federal Govt and vaccine makers been
kept secret from the Australian public when taxpayers money has been used to purchase these
vaccines?

4: Why has the Federal Health Department neglected to report and investigate the dramatic increase
in excess mortality since the vaccine rollout in 2021 (10.9% in 2022 and 9.1% in 2023 to date).
(ABS, 2023)
5:   Why has the Australian Government ignored the alarming amount of adverse events reported on
the DAEN website for the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines which are more than the cumulative reports for
all other vaccines from the last few decades.



Hopefully these and many other issues will be investigated in the Covid-19 Inquiry.



Regards,



Michael
