There are so many areas of failure in our government's response to Covid-19, such that I
struggle to know where to start.

I am a small business owner and this is an extremely bad time of year for anyone to give a
considered submission. Everyone is busy with End-of-year and Christmas preparations.

The lack of substance to my submission is not because I don't care, and not because my
problems with the government's response aren't resounding. Far from it.

Let it be noted in short-form that this is the wrong time of year to ask for appropriate
submissions on the huge failures on the government's part in its Covid-19 response.
