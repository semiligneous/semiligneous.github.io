    To whom it may concern,

    I am writing this submission as a very concerned parent and teacher.

    Firstly, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to do so and for your time in reading it. The sole intent is to
    highlight the facts behind my concerns, with the desired outcome seeing potential required solutions being
    implemented, so all Australian’s can benefit in a future together to thrive in our personal health, moving
    forward.

•   Governance including the role of the Commonwealth Government, responsibilities of state and territory
    governments, national governance mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination
    Mechanism and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory bodies supporting
    responses to COVID-19.

-   Early treatment protocols by                           had already been established in the US, Australia did not
    take on board these practical common-sense treatments. Experienced doctors needed to be heard instead of
    being shut down in their opinions and expertise. Early treatment protocols could have saved many lives if
    implemented.
-   Listening to immunologists, who were not compromised by and biased to government bodies or big pharma
    instead of ignoring them. Funding is given to the TGA by big pharma, therefore it is already compromised and
    biased in their approach. One method does not fit all Australian people. Vaccines should and need to be
    optional, not implemented by mandates or coercion of losing the human right to function in daily society. The
    Australian immunisation hand book clearly states that each person’s vaccine statues should be private and
    confidential. Big pharma were the only ones that financially benefited from this pandemic and future
    pandemic.
-   Human rights were ignored, medical interventions were forced by vaccine mandates. Ethical treatment was
    destroyed highlighted by the fact people were sent home without any anti-virial medication. Ivermectin and
    hydroxychloroquine Vit C, Vit D, Quercetin, Zinc were not given as advice to people who supposedly
    tested positive. Doctors need to be free and allowed to treat each patient accordingly, as everybody’s immune
    systems is different. Not all medical inventions suit all people, people need bodily autonomy, freedom of
    choice of what goes into their bodies, especially when the covid vaccines are under provisional use. An,
    experimental new technology MNRA that has never been used before in human beings.
-   Australian Health Protection Principal Committee instilled coercion and did not speak against forced
    mandates. This medical body needed to advocate for people’s health and respond ethically to human rights.
    The National Cabinet, the National Coordination Mechanism / Australian Health Protection Principal
    Committee needed to object mandates and support a non-biased approach. For people to have an open
    dialogue of pros and cons with their doctor.
-   Belonging to the WHO, UN or big pharma, is not of any benefit for Australian and as Australians we did not
    vote these people in. People contacted lawyers during mandates and current mandates are still in place, to
    object vaccines, they quoted the Nuremberg code and our fair work response was “Australia does not abide
    by international law.” So why is our current government still enforcing mandates and clearly in partnership with
    and abiding by international recommendation from WHO UN, big Pharma? For future pandemics we should
    learn that this is not ethical or morally correct as Australian citizens have not voted for any of the people in the
    international world i.e. WHO UN etc.
-   APHRA’s role is to consult with doctors, not to silence them in their personal relationship with their patients.

•   Key health response measures (for example across COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments, key medical
    supplies such as personal protective equipment, quarantine facilities, and public health messaging).

-   RAT tests and PGR test have never been 100% accurate as the covid virus has never been isolated. The
    medical professional continued to implement unnecessary tests. The inventor of the PCR test, Dr^^^^^H
    PhD, quotes, “Anyone can test positive for practically anything with a PCR test, if you run it long
    enough, with PCR if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody. It doesn’t tell you that
    you’re sick.” These tests were never accurate, so many people had false positives, having a wrong
    diagnosis. The medical board needed to consult and listen to the truth about these tests. People were locked
    into their homes, 14 days of isolation with negative PRC tests were still locked up because they were in close
    contact with someone who supposedly tested positive. The military visited people twice during the
    government-imposed lockdowns, doing random checks on those forced to quarantine. Children locked into
    their houses and despite whole families tested as negative on the PRC, they were still locked up.
-   Children were not treated for whooping cough because they had a cough. Medical clinics refused to see our
          He tested negative but was still refused to be seen, even though all medical staff had been vaccinated
    and wore masks. MyHBand I were sent to a covid clinic. I was not allowed in unless I showed my vaccine
    status of two doses. Our^|had^^^^^^^^|, we had to wait in a 40-degree day outside the covid clinic,
    becaus^n^G^woul^ee him. Our^^did do a PCR test forced by the nurses at the covid clinic which gave
    him a                  The test was negative as well as another RAT given testing negative. All I wanted
    was his^^Hto be heard, for signs                       We were surrounded by positive cases of covid patients
    so this does not make sense and is completely unethical to force people to line up to get tested when
    surrounded by so many others also waiting, who may be covid-positive. These are crimes against humanity.
    Protective equipment, quarantine facilities, and the wrong public health messaging were false as PCR and
    RAT can not test for covid.
-   Masks do not work therefore unnecessary funding/spending of millions on vaccines; protective gear did not
    protect us from getting covid. Masks are worn in surgeries for blood spills, masks are impossible to stop any
    virus because the droplets are so small and slip through any mask. The lack of oxygen to the brain is
    detrimental to people’s thinking, focus skills and oxygen hydration levels. Masks were a waste of money and
    not effective. The medical industry knows this, covid virus as like the flu / cold and any virus can be caught
    though eyes, ears etc. Sick people get sick more easily, therefore educating people on building their immune
    system would have been a better approach. Fear was driven into the public which put our health system in an
    unnecessary panic and strain on staff, paramedics, hospitals and people's stress mental health, as people
    were going to the hospital with mild symptoms.
-   Quarantine facilities was another waste of tax payers’ money. Again, if medical board thoroughly did their
    research and read the documentation from vaccine trails, they would have known and most likely did know,
    that vaccines did not stop transmission. Again, Early Treatment protocols should have been used and only the
    people that displayed symptoms should have stay home to recover with anti-viral medication.

•   Broader health supports for people impacted by COVID-19 and/or lockdowns (for example mental health and
    suicide prevention supports, and access to screening and other preventive health measures).

-   The facts and statistics showed the high increase of domestic violence, peoples mental health, all increase
    due to lockdowns. Lockdowns were not effective and are against people’s human rights and freedom of
    movement. And we need to learn from these major mistakes, so we can protect people’s wellbeing, because
    this should be the Commonwealth Government’s responsibility, as well as the, national governance
    mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination Mechanism and the Australian Health
    Protection Principal Committee) to ensure they support Australian citizens, who incidentally pay their salaries.
-   Mandates were unnecessary as we knew from the science, that vaccines did not stop transmission or getting
    covid. If the medical industry was truly non biased and if the TGA did their job effectively, they should have
    spoken out honestly and told the public that these vaccines do not stop spread or getting covid. The fear
    narrative was highly pushed by National Cabinet, the National Coordination Mechanism and the Australian
    Health Protection Principal Committee), instead of implementing early treatment protocols which work very
    effectively. The main stream news TV and government leaders implemented fear, false evidence appearing
    real. Anyone who spoke differently, who were and are critical thinkers were censored and still are being
    censored. Social media censored and still are censoring links about the death toll, adverse reactions etc.
-   Countries such as Bulgaria and other European countries did not implement lockdowns and they thrived.

•   International policies to support Australians at home and abroad (including with regard to international border
    closures, and securing vaccine supply deals with international partners for domestic use in Australia).

-   Vaccine supply border closure has damaged our economy and society's health. There is a shortage of
    essential medicines, HRT hormone replacement therapy for women is in major shortage. I called the TGA and
    they ‘blamed’ it on covid. It is the TGA’s / government's responsibility to ensure essential medication is in
    abundant supply for tax payers first, as a priority.
-   All Australian citizens should have been welcomed home from travelling abroad and only isolate if they’d
    shown symptoms. Again, early treatment protocols implemented for people showing cold symptoms would
    have saved lives and money on unnecessary vaccine role outs.

•   Support for industry and businesses (for example responding to supply chain and transport issues, addressing
    labour shortages, and support for specific industries).
-   We should not be replying on overseas supplies. We need to learn from this and establish better supplies for
    Australian’s and support small business. Lockdowns have and are still causing (after-effects) suffering.
    Australia needs to be more self-sufficient in all industries within its own country.
-   If we did not have lockdowns the government did not have to pay businesses or people paid from isolating.
-   The Albanese Labor Government has committed $100 million in taxpayer funds to the World Health
    Organisation, despite cost-of-living crisis facing most Australians and the WHO's appalling track record during
    the pandemic. This money should be going towards Australian citizens.
-   Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong announced a funding package at the UN General Assembly, following a
    convention debate in the area of Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (PPPR). Again, more
    unnecessary funds going overseas, these overseas bodies are not voted by Australian people yet our ‘elected
    leaders are readily submitting to unelected entities.
-   The Albanese Government is providing $75 million in funding over five years to the WHO and a further $25
    million for the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. “COVID-19 demonstrated that global challenges
    require collective action,” Minister Wong said in a statement. Collective dialogue should be with Australian
    people only.

•   Financial support for individuals (including income support payments).

-   Misuse of funds, we did not need income support payments, people who were paid less in their regularly jobs
    were earning more and people also manipulated the system. Again, vaccines costed millions without proper
    investigation. If documents had been read, the risks and effectiveness would and should have been
    communicated throughout the public, to ensure true safety. These were a waste of money instead of
    implementing early treatment and providing already safe and effective drugs that have been in use for over 65
    years i.e. Ivermectin. A cheaper alternative, however, these were ignored because no money would have
    been made on this.

•   Community supports (across early childhood education and care, higher education, housing and
    homelessness measures, family and domestic violence measures in areas of Commonwealth Government
    responsibility).

-   Early treatment and allowing doctors to treat in their own personal manner with safe and effective drugs
    already in use for over 65years such as ivermectin, and hydroxychloroquine. Education to the public on
    common sense measures around supplements VIT C, D, zinc etc. which enhance the immune system.
    Educating the public, on nutrition garlic / ginger which are, anti-inflammatory foods etc. Therefore no one
    should have or needed to be locked up in their homes, or home schooling.
-   Locking up the elderly in a small room for lOdays is a crime to humanity not be able to see their loved ones,
    or people not allowed to see their dying family members in hospitals. Again, adding to people’s mental health,
    as we all know that when people are in fight or flight in high stress, their immune systems are compromised.

•   Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular populations (including across
    genders, age groups, socio-economic status, geographic location, people with disability, First Nations peoples
    and communities and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities).

-   Regardless of gender, age groups, socio-economic status, geographic location, people with disability, First
    Nations peoples and communities, people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, this point is
    unhelpful as WE are all human beings. All Australians deserved early treatment and safe and existing drugs
    that worked.
-   Scientists that are non-biased to big pharma, should have been allowed a platform to speak on the media and
    the government bodies should have encouraged this. Open discussions are initial for freedom of speech of
    supposably living in a democracy. Facebook, community website, YouTube, google were all censored, if
    anyone spoke about alternative treatments, they were shut down, doctors’ licenses were suspended and the
    government sadly gave misinformation and disinformation on vaccine safety.

    *Please refer to attached documents as evidence, website statistics.
    Thank you for taking the time to read this submission, and the future of our country is vitally important so let
    us learn from the many past mistakes during covid. Because we need to re-establish human rights, freedom,
    democracy, drop mandates and fear narratives, respect people’s bodily autonomy, for people to have the right
    to choose NO for any future vaccines.
    People who said NO to these provisional use, experimental vaccines, are the ones who survived death and
    adverse reactions, and long-term side effects, being a critical thinker and questioning things is a human right.
