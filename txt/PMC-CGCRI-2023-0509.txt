My name is                                                                                 04.05.2022

In answering your questions and to the point, why my employment was terminated from my employer
during Covid 19. I was signed off on sick leave for stress related illness^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^M


                 this was also before the deadline mandates for Covid 19 shots were in place by the
government and my employer.



My employer terminated my employment After using up all my sick leave and
holiday entitlement^not getting the Covid 19 shots before the supposed
deadline and being signed off with stress related leave due to the pressure to have a minimum of two
Covid 19 shots in place and on the grounds of health and safety at the time with no safety information
around at the time of Covid 19. Only mandates for all individuals to be done.



I currently have a medical condition which is why I resisted the Covid 19 vaccination as my mother and
sister both had severe adverse reactions to the Covid 19 shots


                                                                    This raised alarm bells for me to
highlight my concerns about Covid 19 if I had the covid 19 shots I too may be at risk due to my
          condition. I can also mention that I have been immunised with all my childhood vaccines so
I'm not against vaccinations just Covid 19 and so little information surrounding its safety at the time
and till this day.



The pressure and my medical condition affected me greatly in my job                               that I
could not function properly in the roll. My doctor gave evidence to my employer stating my medical
condition and has further given me a further letter                     stating that my condition has
not improved due to my poor coping to my recent stressors, I have attached his letter for you as
further evidence in my case. Myfrom birth and was advised
needs to be checked annually after a medical scare                                      that required
hospitalisation for my       condition.



I was kept in the hospital and monitored for over twelve hours                                      this
should also be on my records for you to check, it required an ambulance for me to get to the Hospital.
I was advised to get checked annually in case my symptoms worsened and may require further medical
attention as I get older. This was confirmed by                Dr               & Dr                 on
I also had a                      test done on the                         and reported back on^H
                 by Dr              requesting a further test to be follow up six weeks later checking
for any blood clotting this cam^bacl^^Toi^onclusive which raised concerns. I was instructed the
next test would be done                                           medical centre this would have also
been slowed down due to the Christmas break for any results to be returned and even more pressure
from my employer for me to get the Covid 19 shots before the deadline in



In regards to my divorce                     after^^^^^^|years of marriage that came to an end
that year this also had a great impact on my health and further added to my medical condition being
unable to do my job with the anxiety and pressure to get the covid 19 shots and personal family life
trauma this was by far the worst time of my life which involved some counselling for support to get
through this touch time. I felt that my world was falling apart and felt very isolated as at the same
time restrictions were also in place in shops, pubs or any social gatherings would restrict my
movement and my condition worsened.



My employer threatening me with termination of employment whilst it was not mandatory at that
time to do so, this additional pressure on me added to my employer not taking into consideration my
health status at that time. I'm currently looking for employment in a variety of job sectors that I may
be able to do with my condition to try improving my well fair and keeping in regular contact with my
doctor and my Psychologist^^^^^^^^^|for additional support. I hope my personal information
may support and add to a speedy claim in the future. I'm also considering further action for unfair
dismissal from my employer during that time while on sick leave with evidence of discrimination
dismissal with a doctor's letters for support my case.



Kind Regards
