Submission to the Commonwealth Government's COVID-19 Inquiry.
14th December 2023

To Whom It May Concern,

As far as I am concerned The Covid 19 'pandemic' has been the most traumatic experience I have
ever been through in my ^jyears of age. It is purely the handling of this situation that caused this
trauma, not any disease process. My personal story that I presented at a local council meeting is
below.



thought I had been through the wringer. Little did I know I was walking into a far bigger battle - a
fight for my freedom and that of my family. 2 years On, my fear is not covid or|      but rather
the totalitarian overreach of government creating division and segregation in society.

I have lost lifelong friends, been ridiculed, ignored, verbally abused, discriminated against,
censored, and made to feel like a criminal. My only crime, being guilty of doing my due diligence
and researching before allowing my family to partake in a clinical trial. My prior nursing training
gave me the tools to navigate the data and I saw,

     •        Serious adverse events
     •        Gagging of health professionals
     • Censorship of worldwide experts regarding vaccine safety and early treatments
We chose NOT to partake as our risk/benefit ratio was unfavorable. Early unblinding of the Pfizer
trial after only 2 months of safety data = NO LONG-TERM safety data. We were told safe and 95%
effective. But this is well known to be a misleading figure. Th6 FDA recommend using absolute risk
reduction which in this case was only .84% and that was for the original strain!

I personally know three young men with myocarditis and a young nurse so seriously injured she is
unable to return to work. Reactions are NOT SO RARE.

         ■ spent the night in emergency with chest pain following his second Pfizer jab taken due
to a university mandate. Last week my heart broke as I watched             take a shot he did
not want as he had |

/ have cried with and for many friends and family members since the mandates commenced. Many
have suffered economic duress and career ruin OR been coerced into taking the jab.

We must stop this medical tyranny and return to simpler times where the premise was FIRST DO
NO HARM. Life is for living. It can never be totally riskfree but where there is risk, there must
always be choice.
The number one way that I believe the federal government failed my family and, I was by failing to
implement these bills to protect us from tyranny at a state level. COVID-19 Vaccination Status
(Prevention of Discrimination) Bill 2022 and the Fair Work Amendment (Prohibiting COVID-19
Vaccine Discrimination) Bill 2023.

This led to a myriad of conditions that affected my family and I. Firstly, my husband was coerced into
taking a vaccine that he did not want, to keep his job. Co-incidentally he only tested positive after
vaccination. My daughter and myself remained unvaccinated and have never tested positive. I would
draw your attention to the substantial body of information readily available on the vaccine harms,
despite best censorship efforts! This also affected mine and my daughters ability to work. I could not
work as a carer, and she lost her job as a cashier. Not to mention the fact that we were locked out of
a large proportion of society!

Then let us look at masking. This affected us profoundly and still does as my father is in aged care
and was hospitalized quite during the las couple of years. My daughter was also forced to wear a
mask on public transport most days and often at school too. This often-caused fatigue and
headaches, and in my opinion was very unsafe and unsanitary! The fact that any kind of coercion
and mandates for masks in any setting still exist is totally unscientific, useless, and downright
dangerous. Please see these valuable resources for mor information. The first link is to videos from
Industrial hygienists in the US that successfully stopped masks mandates being legalized in the
United States.

We were all adversely affected by lockdowns too. It was stressful and unhealthy to even have
opportunities to exercise outdoors restricted! All commonsense intervention such as de-stress,
exercise, sunshine, and healthy diet were omitted! Here are some papers on lockdown harms and
ineffectiveness. I have been studying these since the beginning and sending several to government.

The following up on safety data was also problematic. Any other vaccine program would have been
shut down in the past with less adverse reactions. The problems of reporting were also not factored
properly:

Finally, I would like to mention conflicts of interest. Jane Halton should never have been appointed
by the government to review Australia's procurement of the covid gene-vaccines and treatment as
she is the long-term chair of CEPI. I consider CEPI to be a vaccine marketing arm for the Bill and
Melinda Gates foundation. "CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India,
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and the World Economic Forum."
(https://cepi.net/about/whoweare/)

In fact, I believe that we need an entire enquiry into conflicts of interest as they are at the essence of
the problem as far as I am concerned. Please see this presentation for more information.          irie

I sincerely hope that Jane Halton is nowhere near this Inquiry as I believe she should not be
considered independent!

To conclude, I would have to say my life is still turned upside down. Many of my days are taken up
with searching for and disseminating the truth of what is really happening. There are many
thousands of others doing the same, so I am certain that we will see truth and transparency
eventually. May this enquiry help to make it sooner rather than later, so we can all get our lives
back.

I implore everyone involved to conduct a very thorough enquiry and listen to ALL the experts,
including those that have been smeared and placed into the 'misinformation, disinformation' box.
Most of them are highly credentialed and were highly regarded, prior to 2019. That is not a
coincidence!
