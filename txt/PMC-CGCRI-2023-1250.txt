Total Government overreach was the outcome of the covid fiasco.

Forcing everyone to take an untested vaccine is disgusting and sets the Governments (State & Fed)
no difference than China.

It wasn't mandatory but if you didn't have it, you lost your job and couldn't go about your business.

Where is the apology, the "We were wrong"?

The amount of people I know personally that have died "suddenly" when perfectly healthy is huge.

Double standards were at play again (as is normal with the Left), BLM protests were allowed - a
worthy cause they said but anti-lockdown protesters were shot with rubber bullets and gassed.

Hoping for             next time the Government tries to pull this one.

It will come.

Thoroughly disillusioned with the ^^^^^Hgaslighting of all the MP's (bar a few exceptions).

The lesson hasn't been learnt.

All deluded.

All fools.
