covid-19 response - inquiry/consultation

I am writing to make suggestions for the covid 19 response inquiry and
consultation. The points that I feel need attention during this process are as
follows:

• Corrupt vaccine procurement and contracts
• Mask mandates and the validity of their efficacy
• Lockdowns
• Vaccine mandates
• Official misinformation in the media regarding the ability of the vaccines to
  stop transmission
• Vaccine injuries
• Vaccine deaths both died suddenly and those dying later from heart
  damage
• Media censorship
• Silencing of doctors
• The role of APHRA and ATAGI in the censorship of doctors.
• The loss of dignity for those segregated in nursing home and those dying
  alone due to the government rules that were inhumane.

Australia needs a Royal Commission to investigate all aspects of the covid 19
situation and this should be a priority for 2024.

Another aspect of the Covid 19 crisis in need of investigation that has
affected public trust and morale is the heavy handed attitude and action of the
police force. They changed from being those we could call on when we
needed help, to a force that went around seeking and fining people. The very
action of praying in a church brought a $1000 on the spot fine which was
most disturbing. It should be throughly investigated to clearly uncover why
and who justified these actions.
