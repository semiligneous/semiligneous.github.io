Covid Submission 15-12-2023 ( E&O.E) TMA. 3 pages means I cannot explain all ands will o my best. This
need 6 months open time for submission and many public forums and question times..

I am business person who has exported more thanfrom Australia to many countries . Covid solutions and all associated
with have massively damaged the economy and worse HARMED SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AND
NOR THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS. Are these weakened immune systems the reasons for excess deaths, cancer increase +
more. We see covid vaccinated people getting covid, some multiple times, colds. Was natural immunity superior as studies
state, and the inoculations aw aster of time? Cure worse than disease?
I find the 4-week period for this submission to be a total affront and show massive disrespect to the whole nation. Especially when
contrasted with the massive amount the government spent on the Voice REFERENDUM, maybe the 43% of those voted yes
may not in the end be happy with this? The 3-page limit restricts the depth, of information that can be provided. The same with
out 28-day petition time, unlike the UK 6 months which have stopped large number of Australian knowing or participating in petition.
Plus, the numerous time people say they have the system reporting faults and to come back later. So many of these are covid and
health related petitions.

Frankly the handling of Covid and the solutions have resulted in massive harm to people and the economy.
Let’s start with Greg Hunt our former health Minister who said we will have full transparency, that turned out to be untrue. That
means the nation did not get Informed Consent.

Maybe former minister Hunt needs to be investigated and maybe prosecuted for failure to adhere to his commitment, and
all in the government after him who have not adhered to this strong commitment given to the Australian people. This led to
many people who now regret taking the covid vaccines that are gene therapies, and are harmed. Can the new federal NACC
and everyone else who can be involved start mass investigates now. From the NACC how many have breached the public
trust, mused information, not adhering to his declaration to the Australian people, and all other who did the same. State
CC’s, DPP’s have also seemed to do little. Maybe nationwide all government employees right down to local levels need to
read their own code of codes in their employment contracts and that say they have to report all misconduct, corruption or
wrong doing. Maybe a lot of reporting is mandatory in our states too and these contracts.
In the very limited space, I have will highlight areas where, we have had some very massive problems. I will highlight
problems with the W.H.O ., Gain of function, Masks lockdowns, older vaccine misinformation creating false trust, basics
ignored mainly Vitamin D, immune system damage. Media control
  f.H.<
Australia should EXIT the WHO (world health organisation) who is the supposed peak body in the world has been derelict
in its duty to all mankind maybe since the start of the WHO and guiding training and teaching or generations of health
people who have thus give the whole world poor outcomes. Its 84% pharma funded. Our TGA 96%
https://www.bmi.com/content/bmi/377/bmi.o1538.full.pdf, do the NACC and federal police need to start here, and now with
the TGA. Do we add AHPRA. Atagi. OGTR and so much more too.) WHI very focused on vaccines and see little else. It
looks like it supports the pharma funders, and not mankind. That have focused on Pharma and ignored basics, some of those

The government is handing over our boldly autonomy which it thinks it must own to the who in very secret and silent
process The Human Rights commission need to investigate this form a slavery viewpoint, our boldly autonomy and right
to our body is being transferred, who owns us?. That’s process must breach many statues, even Fairwork.

The WHO in 2009 removed death as severity as indicator of pandemic and opened the way for the use of the PCR, which is Nobel
prize winner inventor said it should never be used as test for a disease. We used 30-45 cycles and it was never meant to be used
with more than more than 10-15 due to errors and false positives. Massive incompetence ,negligence and corruption here on its use.
Please see the following links, including the major channels with expert testimony by the Corona committee

IF DEATH WAS STILL USED AS INDICATOR AND NO PCR, would the Covid disease even be declared a pandemic, Do the
WHO’s actions make it possible. In 2007 the PCR caused a false endemic in the USA, how incompetent here and world were people
in choosing to sue this tool. All should be prosecuted who endured this here in Australia

https://odysee.eom/@Corona-lnvestigative-Committee:5 183 video of testimony Many of medical experts. I have seen 20­
30 of this over time and they are shocking. We got no transparency of informed consent.

Our ABC & SBS (public networks) failed the Australian Nation in not giving unbiased views and full information., and need
full inventoried by police ats ate and federal levels, The NACC, all states CCC’s and DPP’s need to investigate these
networks for breach of duty to inform us in unbiased manner, information I see had been reported juts by our taxpayer
funded bodes I think there would have been little taken. The government has shown more betrayal by not showing the
23000 ACMA submissions to the public. Where was so much of the tip of the iceberg in just my 3 pages on the ABC&SBS
Contracts
The fact that Labor and the Greens used legislation blocked us e seeing the contracts with the vaccines companies is a betrayal to
the Australian people. Some have been disclosed from other countries and if ours are similar this is betrayal our nation. Can the
NACC look into the negligence of the people in signing these, even people who look after national security, is their signing them a
corrupt action? Can the NACC access all behind the discussions.

Masks.
Even in 2020 I saw data showing that mask did not even work well in operating. In an hour you could find hundreds of
negative reports. Probably many before 2020. So how come health and government did not to their job.

Should the people who forced these onto people be charged with negligence and grievous bodily harm. If people want to
use them again, they should be investigated and also charged with corruption. Truly this is like an assault and need to be
treated accordingly. They have no positive scientific basis and all government people from federal level to local levels
need to be prosecuted for lack of due diligence or whatever legal infringement is possible, they did such a poor job. Never
to be used again. If this is an indicator of our health system ability, it failed

Lockdowns
               June 2020 this public health experts had enough evidence lockdowns were harmful, how come our system
did not. They should never be used again. We need prosecutions over the ones done and instant charges filed any new. I
heard this in July 2020. https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=biC4nHPYtbA&t=316s So many other have said they failed too.

IF OUR HEALTH SYSTESM AND THE WHO miss this basic nutrient D3 as example and its massive efficacy
how can we trust them on anything. Has mankind been sidelined for pharma profits and maybe other agenda’s
at the expense of people lives and it duality. The past created negligence, corruption and abuses, it brought us
to now and the mega disaster we have. Has the lowest cost best preventative health item maybe for all time
been ignored for covid and so much more. Its improper use and suppression has it led to massive number
dying earlier than need be?
Vitamin D as example of health failure on basics from pre-WW2 and the start of the WHO in 1948. The total poor training
and some would same misguiding of generations of health What we see here can apply to many basics. Data ins in
Subtsack on the subjects. In the Subtsack data source are shown and calculation methods. The main thrust is that this is
in zone that shown massive problems They are based on death reduction being directly proportional to incidence
reduction. A logical first assumption.
From the W.H.O down to local health people don’t know this efficacy it seem that medical board, regulators need to stand
down and be replaced as they have failed massively in their roles. They seems to want to GAG anyone who speaks out
against Pharma. Is this an example of massive malpractice where does this put medical insurance companies and their
liability. The gaggers against “basics” are responsible for all the harm that occurred from their actions.

1 cancer ( breast), Australian death data over 30 years extrapolated worldwide over 30 years., did 15 million people die
earlier than need be? . Breast cancer incidence down 83% at 60 ng/ml 05r 150 nmol/l How do you go and tell all the caring
, compassionate people who wear pink and raise money how a simple nutrient could have saved so many and our system
did not use it. Seems logical that death rate and incidence are directly proportional.

The use and suppression of Vitamin D pre-WW2, given the effects in the first 3 parts, if it had been used properly since
WW2, would maybe > 500 million people die earlier than need be?
https://freespeechisfreedom.substack.eom/p/vitamin-d-part-5-the-who-and-the If all we have to do was raise of Vitamin D
levels to at least the natural levels of those at the equator/tropics? Over 15+ major diseases shown, how can this be
ignored by health system. These graphs are hard data. Newsletter & data sources shown. We really have massive
problems? https://jefftbowles.com/vitamin-d3-deficiencv-causes-most-human-disease/. How many people died earlier than
need be? This is one basic and do we have whole health industry not very aware of this data.
 https://qr.page/g/2sBt7xALSS9 Vitamin D pre-WW2. Hidden history or suppressed, did this put public and world health
almost back a century? Last 12 pages of Jeff Bowles book with his references.
The above has been referred to as it shows gross problems in our health system, if our D levels had been up around 150
nmol/l or 60 ng.ml Covid would have zero effect and we would not have needed the Gene therapies or older vaccines, s,
OUR IMMUNE SYSTESM WOULD HAVE BEEN SO STRONG. Is this a smoking gun of massive proportion about covid but
all the way back to 1920. Could Covid have happened if Vitamin I has not been suppressed. Could pharma have even
grown without poor teaching to health people. How much malpractice & corruption does this reality open up.
