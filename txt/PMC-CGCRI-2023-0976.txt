         Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Enquiry Submission

The following are points that I want the enquiry to examine & investigate

    1.    The failure of the Federal Government to introduce anti-discrimination legislation for those
          choosing to not be vaccinated, to prevent the mandating of the vaccines to stay in the
          workforce.
    2.    Why the messaging that gene based vaccines prevent transmission without any evidence,
          particularly now it has been shown to not prevent transmission.
    3.    The failure of the TGA to properly test the vaccines, and then advise they are safe and
          effective.
    4.        Investigate the evidence for having lockdowns.
    5.    The ignoring of the growing evidence of safe and effective alternatives such as ivermectin &
          hydroxychloroquine
    6.    The ignoring of the excessive deaths since the vaccine rollout, why is there still no
          investigation?
