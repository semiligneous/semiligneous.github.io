Covid Response Enquiry, my
submission.

Most of my life I have worked in
hospitality, occasionally I would
work in an office. I even tried
security once, and I excelled to the
top.
In 2019 I decided to look into
disability support courses, with the
aid of my service provider.
Towards the end of the course in
2020 completing all assignments,
and passing, we began our
placements.
Placement was difficult, as
Australia was in covid 19
restrictions.
Sometimes we could go back to
classes, and sometimes we
couldn't.
Anyway, I managed to complete
the course and begin working in
disability support.
Unfortunately Premier Daniel
Andrews mandated the covid
vaccine in Victoria. And as it was a
new trial, and this vaccine was so
young, I chose not to participate in
the experiment. I do also recall PM
Scott Morrison saying that the
vaccine was not mandated.
Premier Andrews wouldn't hear of
it, and held firm on the mandates.
Throughout covid and still
continuing today, December 2023.
It is still hard to find work in
Victoria,
without a vaccine passport.

Back to covid pandemic protocol
for Victoria.
Mask on, mask off.
Don't go to school, go to school,
as with work.
Mask off when sitting, mask on
when placing order?
Closing small business to force
rural communities into the cities to
shop, made no sense.
Doctors are closed, but Dan
Murphy is open?
My GP said I had "herd immunity",
yet their opinion doesn't matter.
My psychologist said, "I shouldnâ€™t
be telling you this, but I have had a
reaction to the vaccine." I only saw
them once after that. The system
owes me four more sessions.
Alas, I have lost confidence.
Main steam media tried to expose
things, but were suppressed
heavily?

Let's just say, "I understand what
discrimination is now."

I have resigned from Disability
Supports, as I can not lie to my
clients and tell them I am
vaccinated, when I am not. Nor
can I stand by and watch the
gaslighting continue.
Now, I am finding cash jobs so as I
can disconnect from the system as
much as possible. Defund, bailing
in or bailing out... whatever.
No Confidence

Mentally coping, because that is
what I've been trained to do.
I reckon my clients miss me
though. I did make a difference.

Sincerely
