The CO VID-19 Response Inquiry Panel
Parliament House
Canberra ACT
COVID-19Inquiry@pmc .gov.au


                              Submission to the
              Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

We welcome the Inquiry’s review of the Commonwealth Government’s response to the COVID-19
pandemic.


Legal considerations

The mandating of COVID-19 vaccines was in breach of Section 51 (xxiiia) of the Constitution of
Australia1. Wong v Commonwealth (2009) supports this point; “Mandatory jabs and bans on the
unvaccinated? Try getting that past the High Court”2:

Future responses

Future responses to a pandemic must take into account the following:

Excess deaths
Australia now has an unusually high rate of excess deaths, yet the Senate voted to not look into the
reasons for this.3 A future response to a pandemic cannot be effective unless current excess deaths
are investigated. Medical professionals are taking interest in this issue.4

Masks
The report "Do physical measures such as hand-washing or wearing masks stop or slow down the
spread of respiratory viruses?"5         | 30 January 2023) states that the wearing of masks and
N95/P2 respirators may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like
illness/COVID-like illness.

Lockdowns
Signatories to the Great Barrington Declaration6 stated7:

       Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public
       health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening
       cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health -
       leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger
        members ofsociety carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave
        injustice.

Furthermore, the closure of Catholic churches (among other religious places of worship) was also a
grave injustice against human rights.8

Recommendation

Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry should include the actions taken
unilaterally by state and territory governments. The states/territories must be held accountable for the
severity of lockdowns, border closures, coercion to take vaccines, mandatesVoMosscsJousincss
closures, family separations (to name a few). Human Rights Commissioner ^^^^^^^^Hmade
comments about the decision to exclude actions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments
from the inquiry in a media release9 (21 September, 2023).

The Catholic Women’s League of Australia would be prepared to attend a hearing, and requests to be
called to speak.
