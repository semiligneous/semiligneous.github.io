Submission to Covid-19 Response Inquiry Taskforce


I would like this Taskforce to coverthe following things
     •    The novel use of excessive lockdowns (I am a Victorian) and the damaging effects of them; the devastating social effect
          due to isolation, inability to attend dying family members, restricted funerals, wedding postponement plus the effect
          on small businesses. This measure was not in pandemic plans prepared in advance and not used.
     •         Curfews
     •         The unequal treatment of businesses- big ones were able to operate and smaller ones not.
     •         Mask mandates- where was the real evidence that masks prevent transmission?
     •    The misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines- the lie that was pushed by the government and media that the
          vaccines would stop transmission when in fact that was not part of the clinical trials
     •    Vaccine mandates - when has it been acceptable to force people to be vaccinated with a novel vaccine that has not
          undergone full long term clinical trials? Many people were coerced into taking them because they would lose their job
          if they didn't- it is not a "free" choice in that case.
     •         Investigate the true number of deaths and injuries caused by these vaccines, especially when compared to other
          vaccines
     •         The restriction of movement - 5km radius etc
     •         The fear tactics that were used by the governments and the mass media to control the population
     •         The excessive force used by police, especially in Victoria, during peaceful democratic gatherings.
     •         The need for unbiased independent people involved in th is taskforce,
