 Re: Submission for COVID-19 Response Inquiry



 To the panel,

 I provide the following account of my experiences and recommendations relating to the following
 area of review:

 International policies to support Australians at home and abroad (including with regard to
 international border closures, and securing vaccine supply deals with international partners for
 domestic use in Australia).

 I am an Australian citizen living in            since        with my husband and son, who are also
 Australian citizens. We are settled in


 My dad,                                                               passed away           in
        My husband, son and I were unable to get a flight back to                until              is a
 direct consequence of the flight caps imposed on flights to Australia from overseas during the
 pandemic.

 Because of the imposition of these flight caps, we missed my dad's funeral and instead had to watch
 it on livestream. I was unable to be with my family - in particular,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
             at this time of sudden and intense grief, and unable to properly deal with my own grief.

 Still to this day, I feel a twinge of anger and rage at the memory of sitting on my couch
 watching the funeral of my dad                   I ask you to draw on your reserves of compassion to
 truly think about what that experience was like for me. My country, the place I was born and lived for
                   nd where I hold citizenship, the place that
                         and cared for him throughout his life as an Australian citizen, shut me out and
 prevented me from saying a proper goodbye.

 Despite the challenges of the pandemic, my experience could have been very different in the
 absence of flight caps. My husband, son and I could have taken a flight t^^^^^^^^traight away
 and completed two weeks' quarantine in time for us to attend the funeral, which was held^^^
^^^|after my dad died, and be with my family at this time of grief.

 To finally get on a flight to                           after my dad died and share it with only^^ather
 people was truly dispiriting. What is the point and meaning of citizenship if one cannot enter their
 country freely?

 I completely understand why quarantine was required at this stage of the pandemic - indeed, we
 quarantined on our return to^^^^^^Jin a hotel that we chose from a pre-approved government
 list and booked at our own expense. Th^^^^^^Hsystem was not perfect, but there was sufficient
 availability of hotel rooms for us to arrive at the time of our choosing.

 Recommendation
This is my recommendation for the Australian government for future pandemics: do not impose
flight caps and impede citizens' rights to enter their country. Instead, devise a quarantine system
based on adequate supply of hotel rooms, or provide for home quarantine.

I implore you to treat all Australian citizens with respect during future pandemics - those who are in
Australia, as well as those who are overseas.

I implore you to restore my faith, and the faith of thousands of other Australian citizens who found
themselves in similar situations, that our country respects its people and shows compassion to all
during troubled times.



With best regards,
