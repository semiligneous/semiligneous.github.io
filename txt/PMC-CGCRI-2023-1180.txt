Im a resident of rural Victoria. My name is David -^^^^|old male

I adhered to all the government mandates, I got vaccinated as per the guidelines. I
received a vaccinations.             and I took the first opportunity to go to Sydney to try
and see my^^^Hwho was in a                   unit there.
I arrived in Canberra in the way to Sydney to visit a friend. My         went onto Sydney to
visit m^^^^^Hand I intended to go there a few days later. Within a day or two of arriving
in Sydney, my^^^Hwas locked in Sydney by the Gladys Berejiklian government covid
lockdown. So he could not leave Sydney and I could not enter, Then the Victorian Andrews
government closed the border between NSW and Victoria due to Covid.
June 18, 2021 and was unable to leave due to travel issues until December 3,2021. I
stayed at my friends place during this time.I was due for                     No reply from
the state government. Heartless as far as im concerned.

The hundreads of thousands (https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/health-
safety/victoria-considers-easing-selected-nsw-border-restrictions/news-
story/3f219330245883763f2c199383c8243b ) of other people less fortunate than me, we
left to camp out at the border. And stay in hotels for months amasing unbelievable life
destroying debt.
Scott Morrion flew from Canberra to Sydney on fathers day in the middle of the steel ring
around Sydney for fathers day._____
 Chief medical officer Dr^^^^^^|was able to fly into Canberra to give out medical
award to his colleagues while I was vaccinated and could not go back to my home in
Victoria for months.
A great example these leaders showed to us. One rule preaching to us and another rule
for themselves

This action of blocking me from returning home across the NSW/Vic border contradicted
the government’s own statements that if we were vaccinated as per their advice we would
both stop the spread and decrease my chances of getting Covid. Clearly the Victorian
Andrews government did not seem believe their own rhetoric about the vaccines
effectiveness. The suddenness of blocking me from travelling across the NSW/VIC
border Trampled on my rights and broke all trust in them and their promises to look
after the best welfare of its citizens. Great betrayal.

They let movie and tennis stars arrive in Australia, allowing citizens of other countries to
freely go, while blocking me from returning to my home state.

Another concerning element-l went to get my second vaccine but a doctor refused to
believe me when I mentioned Astrazenica vaccine caused ^^|on^^^^^^|of me and
accused me of trying find a legal case against him and the practice. This still plays on my
mind and heart. TraumatisecHs close to how I feel. They subsequently took this vaccine off
the market due                     Imagine how I feel. I dont trus^octor^a^muct^nymore.
Thats not how anyon^noulcnoe treated. This happened at
while I was stuck in Canberra. My loss of trust in Doctors, who clearly were wrong about
the safety of this vaccine is a natural reaction.

Other comments
Big corporations eg Amazon who sell online, still require employing thousands of staff to
organise the business and flourished under Covid. Dont think the public didn’t notice that
Me Donalds fast food chains were allowed to operate, where staff coming from all different
parts of Melbourne were mingling at work cross spreading Covid, to supply rubbish
unhealthy fast sugar food to people. Family run business were shut down and run into the
ground. Many small food businesses could have easily offered takeaway driveby the same
as Me Donalds.

-Police fired rubber bullets into people who dared express a different opinion to
governments vaccine mandates.

Now we have an excess death rate worldwide over and above the norm for ages 16 to 65
which vaccination should have decreased yet the politicians and mainstream media don’t
want to touch this topic. This information is publicly available from good sources eg Dr
Campbells site has many government public available evidence, here is but two of many

Also Alcohol shops were allowed to operate, where alcohol is a known immune
suppressant, where is the health logic from doctors here ?

Other government failures.
Travel
- The Australian government did not act fast on bringin stranded overseas Australians
home. Since the price of tickets went too high many Australians were left stranded
overseas. I was caught overseas when the covid announcement was enunciated by the
government and I had 4 flights cancelled and I was just lucky to get out on the last flight.
After that my friends could not get commercial airlines to fly on and the ones that were
available were^^^|for one way tickets. That’s exactly when the Australian government
should have stepped up. Sadly they didn’t and they didn’t care. Eventually flights were
offered too little too late. Many Australians found out the hard way that the Australian
government turned their back on them. Tough luck. No wonder the national spirit is dying
and post covid people have no faith in governments. We have to rely on ourselves.
 We have found out the hard way. Aussie mate ship is dying thanks to the example of the
state governments especially.

Thank you for reading .
