Australian Government

Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet

Submission: COVID-19 Response Inquiry




Dear Sir/Madam

I wish to make a submission regarding the Australian Government's COVID-19 response.

Health Response:

Due of the implementation of mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations, my family and I suffered many
degradations and hardships such as:

    •   Not being able to enter a shop to buy^^^^| school uniform - I was forced to wait outside
        while^^^H tried on his uniforms for fit. This was humiliating as I was perfectly healthy.
    •       Loss of my job and no income for two years.
    •       was bullied by his company for two years regarding his vaccination status. As a
        result
    •       were forced to submit to vaccination (against their will) to keep their jobs
    •       admitted to hospital closely following her
        vaccinations with extensive blood-clotting in her lungs, stomach and                    ar|d ।
        were not allowed inside the hospital to support or advocate for her due to our vaccination
        status. This has been the most traumatic experience of our lives.
    •   Continual vilification and hate-speech against us (the unvaccinated) on mainstream news
        including by members of Parliament (e.g. Gladys Berejiklian)

As COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent infection, transmission or death from COVID-19, the
implementation of mandatory vaccination is a horrific crime against humans' basic rights. The
vaccines are NOT safe or effective for everybody.

In my opinion, and that of my family, the Australian Government's response to COVID-19 was
completely inappropriate and CRUEL.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Debbie Arnold
