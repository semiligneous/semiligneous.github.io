Thank you for calling for COVID ENQUIRY SUBMISSIONS, from members of the public. I
am a 67 year old female retiree, interested in the subject and have several concerns
regarding how the last pandemic was handled, and some of the outcomes that followed.
With no former experience to draw from, making mistakes was human and inevitable. But
the Australian people can only remain confident in their Government, with a royal
commission undertaking a full investigation.

Some of my concerns are as follows:



1 .Vaccination mandates and the question of legality

From the Australian Human Rights Commission website, under “Are Covid 19 Vaccines
Voluntary” it states that “ the Australian Government’s         policy is that COVID-19
vaccinations are voluntary for ,most Australians, although its aim is to have as many
people as possibly choose to be vaccinated.”1 Further, “it (can) be unlawful discrimination
for an employer to require that his employees be vaccinated”, the response was "If there is
no specific law requiring that a person be vaccinated, employers should be cautious about
imposing mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies or conditions on staff.” 1

While voluntary vaccination might be policy, in reality things played out very differently.
Some business owners who refused to police their patrons’ vaccine status were forcefully
shut down by local authorities and closed their doors for good- for example |
           12 Many people who chose not to receive the vaccine lost their jobs. The use
of QR codes, check ins and sign ins forced employees to police patrons by checking their
vaccine status. It put them in the awkward position for which they were never trained, and
created unnecessary tension between community members.



2 . False or misleading information

a) Vaccine efficacy was either false or misleading. Initially, we were told that the vaccine
would provide full protection, as well as stop the spread in the community. However since
that time, the WHO states that the efficacy is approximately 80%. 3 Initially we were told
that we would need two boosters, then three - now the recommendation is a booster every
6 months. 4

b) Mandatory use of common masks do not prevent infection. The most widely used face
masks were both the disposable 3 ply blue & white type, and cloth-type masks, with the
former being handed out in medical centres if patrons did not have their own. Neither of
these types are effective, as they do not protect against tiny virus particles. 5 It seems,
therefore, that these were mandated simply to give a false sense of security to the wearer.

c) The mRna vaccines do not appear to be as safe or as effectiveas initially touted.
Cardiac events (myocarditis) in young people 18-29yrs have been documented after
mRNA immunisation, which are relatively less common after immunisation with vector or
inactivated vaccines.e mRNA vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious
adverse events of special interest of 12.5 per 10,000 vaccinated. 7 (0.125%), compared to
adverse events of other vaccines, which the Australian Department of Health describe as
“very rare”. 3
3 .Government overreach

From 1st January to 31st December 2020, there was a total of 28,408 cases of
Coronavirus in Australia 9 or approximately 0.11% of the population. In that same year
there was a total, sadly, of 909 deaths or approximately 0.0035% of the population. 9 The
Spanish flu killed 2.7% of the population globally. See the difference?

Most people whether vaccinated or not, got over a covid infection after a few days of
convalescence. The shutting down of the entire country, the crippling of small businesses,
the isolation and increase in severity mental illness, the stranding of people behind
borders: none of these things can be justified when compared to the actual figures of those
infected or those who sadly passed. This was Government overreach on a grand scale,
and the Australian people will not forgive or forget this for a very long time.
