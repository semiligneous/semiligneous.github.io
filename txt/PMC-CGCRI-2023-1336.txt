I would like to detail the events leading to settlement between Stretton and           on 17th May
2022 in the fair work court. Had the matter completed a full hearing, I am unsure of the outcome as
evidence indicated that my presence on site would have been beneficial, however, procedural
misconduct did occur and I was terminated prematurely. The dismissal also may have been
determined as harsh. I am unsure.

My decision weighed heavily on the commissioners information. During the hearing and I believe on
record, the commissioner stated words to the effect
                                                                 remedy requested that should I

I was ask to consider making this settlement offer to         Had I one the case, I could have been
may have been owed a substantial sum larger than that for lost employment over ~6months, and
relocation costs.

After discussing with^^^^^^^^^^^^ldecided tha^^houlc^ontinue the case and complete
the hearing. This was made know to^^^^H lawyers          and the commissioner. The

with me. The associate^^^^^fwas present.


The commissioner indicated thatwould accept a settlement offer. He advised:
    -      that given the evidence I was required on site.
    -      No other cases have won.
    - It would be better for me to walk away from the case with some cash rather than walking
       away with nothing.
    - Reinstatement would not be an option in ~8 weeks and my desired outcome would not have
       occurred.
    -      If I was likely to win the case, he would have told me.
    -      That I should take the offer.

Given the commissioners advice, I changed my decision, and decided I would accept a settlement
offer.

On the day the offer was accepted b\          |at approximately ~2.30pm. I signed the settlement
form, however, no representative of           was present and had the authority to sign the form.

Due to a confidentiality clause, I am unable to speak about the terms of the settlement except to
certain persons or in certain situations.

Dear Committee

I submit this evidence-based statement to shed light on the egregious shortcomings in the
government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, exemplified by the unjust termination of
Mr. Joshua Stretton, a Project Engineer at                                Mr. Stretton's
distressing experience not only underscores the critical flaws in governance but also
highlights deficiencies in health response measures, broader health supports, international
policies, support for industries and businesses, financial support for individuals, community
supports, and mechanisms for targeted responses.

Summary of Mr. Joshua Strettonâ€™s Case:

Mr. Stretton, a Project Engineer, faced an unjust termination due to the vaccination mandate.
Despite seeking clarity on vaccine safety and risks, his inquiry received no response,
highlighting inadequate communication. The termination process lacked transparency, raising
concerns about potential human rights violations. The abrupt loss of employment also left
Mr. Stretton without adequate mental health and suicide prevention support, housing,
financial or legal support, compounding the challenges he faced. During dispute of the
termination, the court judge persuaded Mr. Stretton that the case would not be won, even
though termination during periods of leave is forbidden by work place legislation.

This specific case vividly illustrates the urgent need for comprehensive reforms in
governance, health response measures, and support mechanisms to address the glaring
inadequacies in the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Human Rights Violations and Violation of Informed Consent: Mr. Stretton's case raises
concerns about potential human rights violations, particularly regarding employment
termination based on vaccination status. Furthermore, the lack of a transparent process for
informed consent highlights a fundamental violation of individuals' rights to make informed
choices about their health.

Recommendation: 1. Conduct a thorough review of potential human rights violations, and
fair work violations in pandemic-related policies and actions, specifically employment
termination. 2. Strengthen mechanisms to ensure transparency in the informed consent
process for medical interventions, and do not mandate medical intervention without thorough
evidence based information available to the public. 3. Publicise any medical contracts for
government deals for public reassurance and transparency.

I urge the committee to meticulously consider these detailed instances rooted in real-life
experiences to drive essential policy changes and enhance the efficacy of future pandemic
responses.
1. Governance:

Mr. Stretton's unjust termination reveals a lack of clear directives during the vaccination
mandate, exposing potential human rights violations related to employment termination due
to vaccination status. This incident emphasizes the urgent needfor explicit guidelines
ensuring transparent andfair implementation of COVID-19 measures in workplaces.

Recommendation: Develop explicit guidelines for transparent and fair implementation of
COVID-19 measures in workplaces, addressing potential human rights violations and
emphasizing informed consent.

2. Health Response Measures:

Mr. Stretton's inquiry into vaccine safety and risks received no response, indicating broader
issues of insufficient communication and transparency regarding COVID-19 vaccines. This
case underscores the needfor robust risk assessments and transparent due diligence
processes to ensure employees are fully informed about potential risks and benefits,
respecting their right to informed consent. TGA data sheets were lacking in areas of concern
such as toxicity, interaction with other conditions, affects on fertility for women and
especially for men, and breastfeeding.

Recommendation: Advocate for transparent risk assessments and due diligence processes
regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Ensure employees are fully informed about potential risks
and benefits, respecting their right to informed consent.

3. Broader Health Supports:

Mr. Stretton, terminated due to the vaccination mandate, lacked adequate mental health and
suicide prevention support. The abrupt loss of employment exacerbated mental health
challenges andfinancial challenges, highlighting a gap in support systems.

Recommendation: Implement comprehensive mental health support systems for those
adversely affected by pandemic-related employment terminations, addressing potential
human rights violations and considering broader impacts on mental health.

4. International Policies:

Doubts linger about the efficacy of international policies influencing domestic vaccine supply
deals. This emphasizes the needfor a reevaluation ofpolicies to ensure Australia's pandemic
preparedness, specific to Australia and influenced only by evidence basedfacts.

Recommendation: Conduct a thorough assessment of international policies to secure
domestic vaccine supply deals. Learn from experiences to refine policies and enhance
preparedness for future pandemics based on evidence based studies.

5. Support for Industry and Businesses:
Industries struggling with labor shortages and disruptions in supply chains, including Mr.
Stretton's role, face inadequate government support. The lack of a coordinated strategy
exacerbates challenges faced by businesses and employees. Businesses sort to maximise their
own safety and used this event and direction as a reason to terminate employees with little
compensation and thought about employee wellbeing, or options for alternate arrangements.

Recommendation: Foster closer collaboration between the government and businesses to
develop strategies to maintain the existing labour, mitigating supply chain disruptions, and
providing targeted support to affected industries. Identify and rectify shortcomings in existing
support mechanisms. Require businesses to extensively evaluate options for alternate
working arrangements prior to any termination and make these options and evaluations
available to the employees for comment. Require and support businesses to re-employee after
temporary requirements are ceased.

6. Financial Support:

 Insufficient income support exacerbates challenges for individuals facing pandemic-related
job losses. The termination without proper notice adds to financial strain during the
pandemic. Termination also occurred during a time of leave which is against work place
 laws. Termination during this period also cause Mr. Stretton to lose housing for him and his
family, forcing the family to leave      a place with insufficient housing to support people
 without work. This further added strain during a time that was already financially difficult.

Recommendation: Scrutinize and enhance income support mechanisms to provide effective
assistance to those adversely affected by pandemic-related employment terminations,
ensuring their financial well-being. Address potential human rights violations in the
termination process.

7. Community Supports:

Sectors like early childhood education, higher education, housing, andfamily and domestic
violence support lack targeted measures, further magnifying the impact of the pandemic on
vulnerable populations. Particularly when young people under ~30yo had more risk of
adverse events from vaccination as opposed to the virus. ( Weighing up the potential benefits
against risk of harm from COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca-Information for health care
providers to help consumers make informed decisions,29 June 2021, Australian
Government.)

Recommendation: Propose tailored measures to address the specific needs of individuals
impacted by pandemic-related challenges in these crucial areas. Recognize and rectify the
diverse circumstances faced by different communities, ensuring comprehensive community
support.

8. Mechanisms for Targeted Responses:

Decision-making processes do not adequately consider diverse perspectives, neglecting the
unique challenges faced by different populations. Mr. Stretton's case underscores the
importance of inclusive mechanisms in decision-making for tailored responses.
Recommendation: Advocate for inclusive mechanisms in decision-making to ensure tailored
responses for various demographic groups. Recognize and address the unique challenges
faced by different populations, emphasizing equitable pandemic responses.

Sincerely,

Joshua Stretton
