Submission and Evidence to the COVID Response Inquiry


I Glen Morris married with 2 children, involved in my community and sporting organisations, with
other interests including history, economics, philosophy and theologies. This Pandemic did
nothing but destroy our society on so many levels that the effects will last more than a number of
generations. It further diminished confidence in our institutions, medical systems, and trust in
government that has enable the Western World to prosper.

Personally due to my stance on pandemic response and openly not wanting to be injected with
experimental injection. I have experienced in that time:
1. Discrimination, alienation and financial coercion at my work
2. Hate
3. Isolation
4. Depression and anger
5. My religious beliefs and rights dismissed.
6. My relationship with my brother, who stop talking to me, after my decision to not be injected.
7. 6 days after receiving the injection in 2021, ended up in hospital for 2 months
   with 6 specialists trying to keeping him alive plus ongoing medical treatments.

8. Family Member 1 - following her injections had a lump in the breast formed and removed.
9. Family Member 2 - subsequent to her injections has now just found out she has two lumps,
   they will be biopsy in the next week. And I have no doubt, need to be removed.
10. Family Member 3 - who can not fall pregnant, though she had no issue before receiving the
   COVID injection.
11 .^^^^^COVID Injected twice) and I contracted COVID within a week of each other. I was in
   bed for 3 days and no ongoing issues. ^^^^Jwas in bed a for week and half, with lingering
   issues.
These don’t included indirect stories of children who went to same school as my children, who
committed suicide or just died suddenly.



The Federal Government Members of Parliament (Liberal /Labour including political aligned
bureaucrats, with exceptions of minority MP’s) failed in their duties to law and its citizens to
uphold
1. Human Rights Act 2004 (Cwlth & Qld)
2. Privacy Act 1988 (Cwlth & Qld)
3. Industrial Relations Legislation Act 1991 (Cwlth & Qld)
4. Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cwlth & Qld)
5. Nuremberg Code
6. Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cwlth & Qld)

The actions of Federal Government along with collusion with Australian States & Territories were
manipulated or induced by big business/elites, media via World Economic Forum (WEF) and
World Health Organisation (WHO) to exploit fear and division into our society.

During the Pandemic Federal Government actively directly or indirectly sowed or perpetuated fear
and division via censorship, misinformation, disinformation and malformation. This resulted in:
•   Tyrannical invasion of medical privacy
•   jab injuries
•   faulty PCR testing
•   mask mandates
•   lockdowns
•   border closures
• exclusion zones

The Government system and history of these pharmaceutical companies mentioned in attachment
is reason why they need to be excluded along with their associations from our medical system and
society. Therefore my recommendations to the following made regard to your inquiry.

“The Inquiry will adopt a whole-of-government view in recognition of the wide-ranging impacts of COVID-19 across
portfolios and the community. Specific areas of review may include, but are not limited to:


  ‘        Governance including the role of the Commonwealth Government, responsibilities of state and territory
           governments, national governance mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination
           Mechanism and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory bodies supporting
           responses to CO VID-19.”
