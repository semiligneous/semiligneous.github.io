I am an immunocompromised mother to a pre-term baby and worry terribly that our
government will again put the economy ahead of people’s lives. There is no money in the
world that is worth killing innocent people for.

Government responses to pandemics need to be made with the most vulnerable to illness in
mind. Letting a virus run rampant, as the government is now doing forces those like us to live
in perpetual home quarantine. We can’t even go to doctors or hospitals without being
exposed as mask mandates are no longer in effect.

Everyone should wear a mask and the government needs to ensure every public place has
adequate hepa filters so that vulnerable people can at least leave their homes to get
necessities and medical care.

I’m ashamed to be a part of a country where people have decided they are willing to sacrifice
other Australian’s for their own gain.
