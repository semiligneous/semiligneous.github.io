The effect of 'Covidicus' upon me.

I name this mv fourth and greatest trauma exoerienced throughout mv life and. unlike the
last two                                                                      , I remained
horribly cognitively capable of processing the horror occurring in real time.

My^^took me from an international performance career to acute rehabilitation.
Separating myself from the merry go round of therapists and rehab options involved a
career shift, and, clothing myself in the mantle of 'disability arts' was an appropriate move
to make. Inching forward, over 20 years I progressed from lowly, token positions to
producer. After^^^|l made the move to                    where I began my trajectory in this
difficult-to-make-progress sector all over again.
With the first Lockdown instituted in 2020, I found myself with 7 part time positions in arts
and advocacy. I thought this was an intelligent decision as long days housebound are a type
of hell for me; and as the weeks and months rolled on, hell took on new shades and
dimensions. An effect of^|is lack of ^^^^^|or                       which, unfortunately, was in
full display. Concerned for my health and safety with the history of^^^^behind me, I
researched the oncoming tidal wave of 'encouragement' to jab ourselves with a rushed
medical preparation. Thus the online meetings I took part in every day were coloured by my
concerns and commitment to keeping myself uninjected.
Time passed. Whilst I used it to both work constantly, taking advantage of my geographic
location being close to the sea to both exercise and mentally escape the strictures, I
continued to research the channels and media I knew were giving truthful accounts
countering the blanket assertions of 'safe and effective'.

Here I stand now over 3.5 years from first being taxied home from the office with an office
chair, still unjabbed and^^^^^^B alienated, ridiculed and ignored by what used to be my
community. Resulting in the loss of all 7 positions, I now am striking a new road giving me a
sense of autonomy whilst fielding the lasting mandates and 'policies' of the sector. I have
accepted a position on a national board and yet remain unsure whether this will come to be
because of how I utilised what used to be a rightful choice in order to protect mySelf from
the^^^^^^^^Hso many others unknowingly signed up for. Especially if there was prior
experienceof^^^B, the likelihood of coming out of remission rises by over 1,000% after a
CV 'vaccine'. I personally know 3 people who have died of ^^^Hn the past years and am
aware of the giant leap in the incidence of cancer worldwide.

My choice remains sacrosanct. I intend to be around a while longer.
So I should, I've worked hard for this.
