To whom it may concern

I have been personally impacted by the government's response to the Covid pandemic.

I lost my job due to mandates created by my employer/the government. I went from being
publicly thanked for “being there” for my students, to being reprimanded for gross
misconduct. (Gross misconduct is the category for abusers of children) As I was unable to
find any safety data about the vaccine, even after repeated requests for information to my
employer and the TGA, I felt I could not make an informed decision and refused to take the
vaccine. The coercion imposed on me and my colleagues by the government and my
employer was indefensible.

I am so grateful I didn't take that vaccine. We were told repeatedly that the vaccines were
safe and effective. Effective! Most people I know who have had the vaccine have had
COVID repeatedly. Clearly NOT effective. I know people, and have heard of many more in
Australia and all over the world, who have had their health impacted and many have paid
the ultimate price, death. And yet the government has continued to completely ignore the
effects these dreadful injections have had on these people. They have gone so far as to
deny vaccine injury, when clearly something is very wrong. Excess deaths in countries that
rolled out these vaccines are skyrocketing, but we are still encouraging and even forcing
our citizens to have more. They need to be stopped immediately. And the government
misinformation needs to be held to account.

We need to get to the bottom of the campaign waged against those who chose not to take
the shots by the government and the media. We were publicly vilified by both and treated
like lepers. What sort of country has Australia become that this is acceptable?

I strongly request a full Royal Commission and proper investigation into the whole sorry
saga, that continues to unfold, even now.

Respectfully
