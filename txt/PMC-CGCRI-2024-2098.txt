                                      COVID 19 SUBMISSION



We need an honest Public Health response which includes:



   1)      Accurate, uncoloured information from expert medical people.
   2)      Availability of vaccines for those of all ages who wish to access these.
   3)      Measures in public places to address the known risks of an airborne disease.
   4)      Study and recognition of long-term effects on individuals.
   5) Appropriate arrangements in all Health Care settings and appropriate modelling by Health
      Care Workers.
   6) Covid 19 is an airborne disease. To focus on ineffective messages vis handwashing as the
      significant strategy is to deny the reality of the disease.
       Equally it is an insult to the intelligence of the public to urge "be kind to those WHO CHOOSE
      to wear a mask" People should be encouraged to act for minimum spread of the disease, and
      not patronised or subliminally derided as being unusually anxious.
   7) As in the US people of all ages should be eligible for the vaccine. What good is it to protect
      the elderly when the generations of their families and carers are unable to be vaccinated
      regularly? Why should a small child have their development and future scarred because their
      parent has repeated infections and suffers ill health and loss of earnings?
   8) It seems that the short term economic effects of absenteeism have overridden the need for
      proper health measures. Long Covid illness should be recognised and studied . Employees
      will bear the economic burden of employer requirements to attend work while unwell.
   9) In recognition of the true nature of the virus there should be appropriate measures in
      workplaces, such as ventilation standards. These and other requirements such as suitable
      mask wearing should be modelled in all Heath Care settings.
