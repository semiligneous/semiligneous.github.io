SUMMARY OF EVENTS LEADING TO                           UNLAWFUL SACKING BY


   •   ON 2 Nov, 2021 all staff received an email entitled 'Proposed policy requiring covid-19 vaccine'.
   •   All staff invited to respond.
   •   I responded asking questions after the safety and efficacy of the novel technology.
   •   I also asked after the lawfulness of such a direction to medicate.
   •   In the months prior I had been bullied by other staff with regard to their perception of my
       position.
   •   One staff member raised his docks and invited me to fisticuffs after having told me that I
       "deserve to die". I walked away and reported his behaviour to my supervisor.
   •   Another staff member, as a daily staff meeting ended, suggested we play a game. He pointed at
       the staff member nearest him and asked, "Injected or infected?". I walked out of the meeting
       and was approached soon after by the duty manager, who apologized on his behalf.
   •   I sought to know, via text initially, if stress leave was available to me and received no response
       or acknowledgment.
   •   Last shift worked was on 7 Nov, 2021.
   •   Officially stood down for 'non-compliance' 17 Dec, 2021.
   •   The response that I received to my initial reply to 'Proposed policy requiring covid-19 vaccine'
       was ignorant of my questions and referred me to government sources only.
   •   I replied and highlighted these facts and began correspondence with^^^^^M (HR) and^^J
               (at the time Regional Manager).
   •   After requesting a reply from^^^^^^^Hl received, in essence, the same referral to
       government advice and no questions answered.
   •   fast-tracked an appointment with a psychologist through the EAP.
   •   The psychologist advised me that I am suffering
   •   That stress continues to this day.
   •   HR continued to send emails advising me of my 'non-compliance'.
   •   Emails included in my original submission to HRAA
   •   I continued replying with my questions over safety and efficacy and lawfulness and continued
       receiving no answers, but only threats.
   •   I offered links and data that clearly demonstrated the difference between the corporation's
       claims and the truth.
   •   continued the stand over tactics and made one last attempt to browbeat me with a
       "Meeting Request".
   •   This request was received on Friday 21 Jan, 2022 and stated that I was required to attend a
       phone meeting on Monday 24 Jan, 2021.
   •   I was advised that I was entitled to arrange a support person.
   •   The reason for the meeting was; "We have sent numerous reminders to you and you have
       subsequently been stood down from duties, due to your non-compliance. The attached
       document outlines the date and time in which I wish to hold a discussion with over the
       phone, to understand in greater detail what is preventing you from complying with this Policy,
       prior to us making a decision on your ongoing employment.”
   •   I requested a deferral due to the short notice and to arrange an appropriate support person.
   •   further replied that the 'meeting' would now be a short questionnaire that I must
       answer.
   •   The questionnaire and my responses are included in my original submission to HRAA.
SUMMARY OF EVENTS LEADING TO                           UNLAWFUL SACKING


    •       Without further consultation I was unlawfully sacked on 15 Feb, 2022.
    •       The demeaning and belittling nature of the whole process has been debilitating.
    •       Compounded by having been excluded from society on Dec 17, 2021.
    •       I continue to suffer^^^^^^^^^^^^^^l on a regular basis.
    •       I was rebuffed by the fair work commission. (It appears that I hadn't properly made application)
    •       We have used up all of our savings as it took until May 2022 for me to find some casual work.
    •   Many employers are stilling asking about medication status on application, which makes it
        difficult to find further work.



This is not a complete retelling of events. This does not take into account the impact on my        and
our life during and since.
