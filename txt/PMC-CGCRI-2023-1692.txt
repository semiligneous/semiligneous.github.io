I am aH year old disabled late diagnosed^^^Bwoman with complex^^Hwho is currently
living with parents in their^s.
I am vulnerable to Covid 19, I have had Health problems in the past that are considered to fit the
definition of vulnerable to catching this virus. So far I have avoided being infected even though
my parents have had it once so far in our household. Since the pandemic was declared, it has
taken up a lot of my energy and effort in remaining covid-free. My dedication to avoiding
Covid19 has meant I haven’t been safe in seeking healthcare treatment for other illnesses and
prevention since the initial public health measures protecting others in the wider community
were completely abandoned. I have been isolating at home since 2020 and this has taken a toll
on my mental health as well as physical health. I wear P2 respirator masks in public when I
need to do food shopping, and have to attend a local chemist 3 times per week for my
medication. Being dosedessential for my functioning and when I do, I risk
infection with SARS-Cov-2 every time I dose in public because I must take off my mask to drink
it around other potentially sick or asymptomatic people who are not required by law to wear a
mask in the chemist, including staff. It was a major risk throughout lockdown, especially before
vaccines. I had to attend the chemist for my oral dose 6 days per week for most of 2020 & 2021.
I had started dental treatment in 2019 that included multiple teeth extractions with the goal of
getting partial dentures via the public dental scheme. This was cancelled in the public health
emergency, essentially delayed halfway through treatment. My dental health needs still haven’t
been completed almost 4 years later due to known risk of airborne transmission.
I’ve been unable to since there’s been a high chance of being infected so I have been eating
with only| teeth left in my gums. This has caused further damage to my teeth so I’ve been
saving money to get it done somewhere private where I might be able to request air purifiers
and N95 masks be worn.
I have been vaccinated and boosted but the chance of Long Covid is high enough even with
vaccination that I don’t want to risk it.
I have already had a long term^^^^^^^^| condition following                            as a
teenager and affected me into adulthood. I don’t want to go through anything like it again.
I later had^^^^^^^|in my 20s and then also^^^^^^in my 30s.
I think all that it is reason enough to avoid further damage of contracting a novel coronavirus -
against my will- that’s been proven to have disabled or killed millions of others in such a short
period of time.
