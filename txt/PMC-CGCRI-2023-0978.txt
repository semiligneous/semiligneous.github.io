To whom it may concern.
I am writing to you as a concerned Australian citizen. Never before in my
life of over 70 years have I seen the restriction of movement and doubling
down on the rights of citizens as I have seen over the past 4 years. What
has happened to our country where the overreach of Premiers such as
Annastacia Palaszcuk have directly inflicted death and damage against
the people of Queensland by her Border closures, the holding of people in
quarantine, the limiting of people to enter shops and places of worship as
well as stopping people from visiting the elderly, paying respects at
funerals and visiting those who were ill. The unlawful “mandates” of
vaccines and the eviction of people in public housing, and loss of
employment for some if they did not get the experiment injection. The use
of the Police to enforce this overreach by Government bodies for the
mandates and the bullying by police on those who were forced to wear of
masks is a violation of civil liberties and was undemocratic. The brutality
of the Police on peaceful protestors, particularly in Melbourne, Sydney
and Canberra and against people who wandered outside their designated
areas is something that should never again happen in a democratic
country. I am ashamed and horrified that the Federal Government under
both Morrison and Albanese allowed this to happen. This overreach that
occurred all across Australia needs to be investigated fully and every
State Premier the Health Ministers and Bureaucrats involved need to be
thoroughly investigated over their involvement in the treatment of
Australian Citizens. This should never happen again.
