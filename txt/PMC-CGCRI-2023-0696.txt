There needs to be accountability, transparency and justice for the victims of the government’s response to
Covid.

At a minimum, the outcome of the inquiry should include:

   •   The public release of any government contracts signed with third party providers, e.g. Pfizer, testing
       companies, jab clinics, etc.

   •   The public release of the financial records of any politician, bureaucrat or person in public office who
       gained financially, or whose family members gained financial benefit, either directly or indirectly from
       the pandemic or response, e.g. links to testing companies, etc.

   •   The establishment of a process for the expedition of criminal charges against any individual who
       used threats or coercion to force, or attempt to force, another person to be vaccinated against their
       will. Vaccination without consent constitutes assault and wounding which is a crime.

   •   The release of all record level data (anonymised) related to vaccination, fatalities and hospitalisation
       so that Australians can be properly informed regarding the health outcomes of vaccinated people.

   •   An apology from the government for the systemic discrimination, malice and ridicule directed at
       unvaccinated citizens from politicians and the media in their “public health messaging”. Many
       Australians were castigated and ridiculed by politicians, banned from events, refused medical care
       and sacked from their jobs.

   •   A recommendation to establish a fund so that all employees stood down or sacked for exercising
       their right to informed consent can be reinstated with back pay and all entitlements restored.

   •   A recommendation that Australia must exit the WHO immediately as this organisation represents a
       grave threat to our sovereignty and national security.
