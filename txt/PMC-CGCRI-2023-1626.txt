Submission to the Covid-19 response inquiry

Australia needs a real inquiry into the COVID-19 response.

Our freedoms weren't for the taking, and we want a proper inquiry - a Royal Commission - into
COVID!

Our serious concerns include:

. Concerns Over Specific Pandemic Measures including mask and vaccine Mandates; lockdowns and
curfews; and fear-mongering communication strategies deployed by public officials.

. Concerns Over the Composition and Scope of the Inquiry including the bias of panel members
overseeing the Inquiry and the exclusion of unilateral State and Territory Government decisions.

. The Need for a Comprehensive Inquiry that encompasses all aspects of the government's response.


Thank you for not sweeping these serious violations of the freedom of Australian citizens under the
carpet,
