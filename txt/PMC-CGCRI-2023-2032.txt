I am a secondary teacher who works in a ^^^Bschool in WA. I have been teaching full-time
for^^^H and was diagnosed in 2022 with

Until February/March 2022, Western Australia was one of the few places in the world to not
have COVID-19. It was idyllic. We knew that the borders would be opened but could not have
envisioned that all mitigations would be dropped, making it extremely difficult to attend work or
access healthcare safely.

The personal impact of the decisions made by National Cabinet to drop mitigations has been
massive for me. In March 2022 Covid started to spread in^^^Hand at first spread slowly in the
school. In one week in May, when indoor mask mandates were droppedjteachers in my
department and the adjacent department caught Covid. I was left to pick up the work of our
other only^^^^^H teacher and the technician for the week they were away. I continued to
wear a mask, but the stress of the extra work on top of my teaching load made my
worsen, and I ‘crashed’ for several days, too unwell to work. Our school did not grant extra
leave for teachers with Covid. The teacher in the department adjacent to mine has had no sick
leave for over a year                                     so he teaches even while very ill and
refuses to test for Covid because it costs him^^Ha day to stay home. I feel unsafe working
with teachers that might have Covid, as they have been instructed to come to work if they feel
well enough to do so and can choose to wear a mask or not.

         is similar to Long Covid (46% of Long Covid cases meet the criteria for^^^^| and
is worsened by any exertion. My condition was classified as mild until August 2023 when I
caught a ^^Hat school, and my condition declined. I am awaiting a serology result to see if the
virus was Covid as I didn’t test positive on a RAT at the time. I worked the rest of the year using
a                                       am currently too unwell to work. I hope to be able to work
at a    load in 2024, which will cause physical strain and financial hardship.

I wrote to the principal of mycollege in September 2022, concerned about
the latest wave of Covid. I advised them that I have           and my condition is likely to
decline if I contract Covid. I sent them information about teachers contracting Long Covid (at the
time we were highest risk out of all professions) and studies on Long Covid and cognitive
dysfunction in children. The principal sent my concerns on to the facilities manager who told me
that HEPA filters ‘do nothing’. We have no mitigations in place at school. Our classrooms are
mostly 40 years old and have poor ventilation. There are no HEPA purifiers, the HVAC systems
are old, and the leadership of the school refuse to mention covid, laughing and calling it ‘the C-
word we don’t talk about at school’. Working in a system that doesn’t take Covid seriously is
difficult when you know it could disable you. I purchased a HEPA filter for one of the classrooms
that I regularly teach in and make sure they are as well-ventilated as I can. I also wear a high-
quality mask, but teaching practical subjects to sick students in crowded classrooms means that
my mask is not always effective.
The school will maintain that they are following government regulations - because there are
none. In September 2022, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that Covid was no
longer exceptional, mandatory isolation would end, and he repeatedly compared it to the flu.
Covid is highly contagious and unlike the flu (which increases risk in pulmonary issues),
damages nearly every system and organ in the body.

Schools with good ventilation/filtration can reduce illness by up to 80%. SafeWork Australia
advise that ‘consistent indoor air concentration of less than 800 parts per million (ppm) CO2 is
likely to indicate that a space is well ventilated’ but classrooms are frequently over 1400ppm (I
have an Inkbird CO2 monitor). If schools were advised they had to meet guidelines for clean air,
then I would have been at a lower risk of disablement from a virus.

As a teacher with                   । have been privy to many conversations with students
regarding Covid. Two students I know have been diagnosed with
the past few months and many others have not been well since their first or second covid
infection and are absent from the classroom with medical appointments and other illnesses.
Repeat infections increase the risk of Long Covid, so I am very concerned for children who will
be contracting Covid-19 multiple times a year. If 46% of Long Covid cases become^^^^^l
many of the students that I teach will become disabled like me in the decades to come.

The public health messaging around Covid has been inconsistent and vague. Most people do
not understand that it is an airborne virus, they do not know how to prevent it or what to do
when they have it. They do not understand that a negative RAT doesn’t mean that they do not
have covid. They do not understand that a person can be contagious even if they don’t have
symptoms. They do not understand that a large percentage of people are asymptomatic. They
do not understand that the vaccines aren’t sterilising and that their effectiveness wanes. They
do not understand that Covid begins as a respiratory virus but is also a systemic vascular
disease.

My frail                       is taken shopping once a week and doesn’t wear a mask because
‘the government said Covid was over’ and ‘no-one else does’. She also doesn’t understand that
if she recovers from a Covid infection that her immunity will be reduced and she could have
longer term complications.                        with^^told me (in late 2023) that she makes
everyone who enters her house wash their hands so that she doesn’t get Covid. She doesn’t
know that it’s airborne.
We need public health messaging about all of these topics. People need to understand that they
can reduce the risk of contracting Covid by wearing a good quality well-fitting mask and by
ventilating and filtering air.

Personally, I am reluctant to seek any healthcare currently as the risk of contracting Covid is so
high. I am overdue for a dental appointment but my regular dentist has small rooms without
HEPA filtration and the dentists only wear surgical masks. Hospital-acquired infections are very
common. I am stunned, that after periods of travel I isolated for 14 days at a time, with police at
my door, and a threat of a $50k fine if I left my house, yet we cannot keep people in Aged Care
and people in hospitals safe from Covid. One                      I know contracted Covid in
hospital during her treatment for         She has                              and        and
had to stop treatment for 2 weeks while she took anti-virals for Covid. We need N95 masks in
healthcare and airborne infection control so that everyone is able to access healthcare safely.

Concerning access to anti-virals like Paxlovid, we need wider eligibility. They help to prevent
Long Covid so are life-changing not only in the short-term, but over many years. I have been
told by 3 doctors that I’m not eligible for Paxlovid, despite data showing that 75% of people with
        Hdo not return to their baseline within 6 months. If I contract Covid I will have to
purchase the anti-virals at a cost of $1080. IVl            is currently ‘moderate’ and I am able to
live independently. I am currently trying to access community care for help around the home. If I
become ‘severe’ I will be^^^^^^^nd will need part-time or full-time carers. In                  online
groups I asked people how they fared after contracting Covid and collected their stories - so
many have declined and are now severe and                    with very little sign of recovery.

It has been a shock to go from someone who was very active in the community, to now be
unable to leave the house; at first because covid became so widespread with the removal of
isolation and income support, and now because I’m in disabled. In the space of 18 months, from
February 2022 to August 2023 my life changed drastically, from being an extroverted artist and
teacher to someone housebound who has found socialising very difficult due to the
government’s minimising messaging that Covid is nothing to worry about.

We need clean air in schools, masks in healthcare and on public transport (high-risk people
need access) and quality public health messaging that covid is not going away so we need to
adapt.
