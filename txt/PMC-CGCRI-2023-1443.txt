The Covid 19 ‘vaccines’, are NOT:


The injectable products, claimed to provide immunity from Covid 19, are
genetic therapies with a novel delivery system, and are NOT vaccines:


The so-called covid 19 vaccines currently being forced upon the Australian
public, are defmitionally not vaccines at all. The scientific definition of a
vaccine is: ‘Therapeutic material treated to lose its virulence, and containing
antigens derived from one or more pathogenic organisms, which upon
administration to humans, or other animals, will stimulate active immunity and
protect against these or related organisms’. They are instead mRNA substances,
which are NOT derived from living organisms. The ‘m’ is for memory or
messenger, ribonucleic acid. The RNA has its sequence of nucleotide triplets
(individual components of the nucleic acid) determining the linear condensation
of amino acids, and forms a protein molecule, which can hold genetic
information, but is in addition, the primary agent for transferring information
from the genome to the protein machinery of the cell. Thus, it is engineered
genetic material, intended to operate at the cellular level, and detect this specific
virus. No such anti-viral has ever been shown to work, or even survive the
extensive in vitro and in vivo research and testing required, which can extend to
seven years in duration.
