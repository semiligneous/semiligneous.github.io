How did I know something was wrong?



The government came up with another mismatch of a market with
bureaucratic characteristics to be the heroes that get to keep their hands clean
and funnel money to their mates. Because the natural thing to do was throw
the kitchen sink at it, instead there was only one "solution". Because everything
was going fine until the government got involved. I know the media is
captured. I know how corporations think. I know we have crony capitalism in
Australia. I know the government is a wannabe corporation. I don't trust
celebrities. I'm a trained data analyst. I lived in China for a while and it smelled,
tasted, and looked the same. And governments are not as smart as they think
they are. If they were, they would do their job properly.
