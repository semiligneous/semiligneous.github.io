Covid 19 Govt response and forced vaccinations

The Govt overstep with Covid 19 response will go down in history as a dark period for
Australia.

The division that was surrounding the forced vaccinations to be able to work in some sectors
was horrendous.

My 26 year old son working the NDIS sector and was made to get the vaccination to be able
to provide for his family and pay the rent. His health has been terrible in the last 18 months.

My mother towed the line and did what she was told to do and despite being in fantastic
health in in her late 70s ended up with an aggressive Lymphoma diagnosis and was dead
within 3.5 months

Me and my family were ostracised in the community and could only go to some places.

There were threats of school vaccination programs.

The death rate spiked in this country and people need to be held responsible.
