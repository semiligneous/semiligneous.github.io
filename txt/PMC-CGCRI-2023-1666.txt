Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry



<,      Members c        ^dependent Panel,

I am writing this submission to voice concerns over certain aspects of Australia's
response to the COVI.        andemic. Whit ‘      ognise the important        le Inquiry's
goal to improve pandemic preparedness, there are critical areas that require thorough
scrutiny.


Concerns Over Spech          demic.Measures


Mask and Vaccine Mandates: The implementation of mask and vaccine mandates had
significant impacts on individual freedoms and social dynamics. The           asures,
often invasive, warrant a detailed review to assess their necessity, effectiveness, and
proportionality.


Lockdowns and Curfews: The economic, social, and psychological impacts of
lockdowns and curfews have been profound. An evaluation of these measures is
essential to understand their long-t      fects on Australian society and whether they
were the most appropriate response.


Communication Strategies: It is quite clear that there was an unwarranted use of fear
in public health messaging. It's important to analyse whether such communication
strategies were effective or whether they contributed to unnecessary panic and
distress among the public.


Concerns Over the Composition.and.Scope of the Inquiry


Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have previously
expressed support for certain pandemic measures raises questions about the
objectivity and impartialh      e Inquiry. Panel members who have expressed support
for such measures should recuse themselves.


Exclusion of Unilateral State and Territory Government Decisions: One of t           st
significant omissions in the Inquiry's scope is the exclusion of actions taken
unilaterally by state and territory governments. These decisions, including state-
imposed lockdowns and border controls, were pivotal to the nation's pandemic
response and should be included in the Inquiry.



                                                                                             1
                                                                       15 December, 2023


Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

                   imprehensive.Review

While the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry are extensive, it is crucial that the above­
mentioned areas are not overlooked. A truly comprehensive review should encompass
all aspects of the government's response, including those currently outside the
Inquiry's scope.


Conclusion


This submission represents a call 1        ore inclusive and thorough investigation into
Australia's C0\          oonse. It also urges for freedom and liberty to not ever be cast
aside with fearmongering as it was by Australian governments during the pandemic. I
urge the Inquiry to consider these points to ensure transparency, accountability, and
the safeguarding of Australian values and liberties.

Yours Sincerely




                                                                                            2
