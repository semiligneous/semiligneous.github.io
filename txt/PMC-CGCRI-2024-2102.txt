Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry terms of reference
Specific areas of review may include, but are not limited to:

    •      Governance including the role of the Commonwealth Government, responsibilities of state and
           territory governments, national governance mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National
           Coordination Mechanism and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory
           bodies supporting responses to COVID-19.
    •      Key health response measures (for example across COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments, key
           medical supplies such as personal protective equipment, quarantine facilities, and public health
           messaging).
    •      Broader health supports for people impacted by COVID-19 and/or lockdowns (for example mental
           health and suicide prevention supports, and access to screening and other preventive health
           measures).
    •      International policies to support Australians at home and abroad (including with regard to
           international border closures, and securing vaccine supply deals with international partners for
           domestic use in Australia).
    •      Support for industry and businesses (for example responding to supply chain and transport issues,
           addressing labour shortages, and support for specific industries).
    •           Financial support for individuals (including income support payments).
    •      Community supports (across early childhood education and care, higher education, housing and
           homelessness measures, family and domestic violence measures in areas of Commonwealth
           Government responsibility).
    •      Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular populations (including across
           genders, age groups, socio-economic status, geographic location, people with disability, First Nations
           peoples and communities and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities).

Dear Inquiry,

A number of excellent international studies have been undertaken to compare and consider issues with
government responses to the covid pandemic. I include links to a number below that I invite you to consider:-

Dear Inquiry,

many claims have been made about the effectiveness of the government's strategies to implement effective

Australia as an island is very comparable in deaths per 1,000 cases at 0.2% with Taiwan, New Zealand, Reunion
all very similar at 0.19% and Sri Lanka at 0.25% and Iceland at 0.11%.
Japan 33.8 M cases, 74.7 k deaths - 0.22%.

Remoteness and island situation is related to low case death rates when compared with continental death
rates: France 39.0 M cases, 167.99 k deaths - 0.43%; USA 103.44 M Cases, 1.145 M deaths - 1.11%; UK 24.84
M cases, 232 k deaths - 0.9735% (noting the English/French channel is a water barrier but there is a rail link
connecting both sides).



Remoteness and isolation early on seem significantly protective but in the Australian situation Victoria fared
       significantly more poorly than other states. The inquiries' terms of reference is perhaps unable to
       completely analyse where state factors are associated with significant differences in outcomes.

Yours Sincerely
