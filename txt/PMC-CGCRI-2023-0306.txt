I had covid according to PCR test. Was granted an exemption by Australian Immunisation
Department. My place of work did not accept it. That is ludicrous.

Doctors grant me an admission and workplace, not doctors, no idea, do not accept doctors advice.

I have since lost the certificate of exemption, sorry.

All this for an illness that has over 97% III! survival rate.

Something is definitely not right.
