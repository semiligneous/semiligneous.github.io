I was Switchboard Operator at a major hospital - SCGH in
Perth, WA & answered for 5 hospitals. I put out emergency
pages, connected doctors within & outside the hospital, input
doctors rosters and answered hundreds of calls from
members of the public amongst many other tasks. It was a
highly trained position. I worked mostly 6 days a week over 24
hour rosters & mostly did nightshifts that others were not
keen on doing. When Covid hit there was a great deal of
pressure to take the experimental vaccine. I did my own
research & found Covid had a 98.9% recovery rate & saw
Israel well ahead of us & the injuries & deaths happening to
young and healthy. I was getting more & more pressure to
take vaccine from management & continual emails giving me
anxiety. As I was casual I was no longer rostered on and
threatened with $10,000 fine if I entered the premises. I have
now lost over 130k in earnings and lost my 20 year medical
industry career.
