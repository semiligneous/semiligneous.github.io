GOVERNANCE including roles and responsibilities [Part 1]

The Australian and State Parliaments are supposed to operate under the
Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act [ short title]

Under the Preamble to that Act it call for us to humbly rely on the blessings of
Almighty God.

Under Section 51 [xxiiiA] it forbids ANY FORM OF of civil conscription, [ which in in
line with both the UN treaties and International Law]

So in essence the mandating was illegal

This same section gave the authority over vaccinations to the Commonwealth
Government and any delegation given under that authority had to confirm to this
provision of the Constitution.

The delegation was never truly delegated and in that failure the State ran their own
programs and the case of Victoria cost hundreds of lives.

CONCLUSION [ Part 1 ]
The needs to be a review of what actually occurred and the need to call Federal and
State Parliaments or their executives [ [Cabinets] to account for the,
       *        1. damage to society
       *        2. cost to both Federal and State Budgets
       *        3. adverse effects resulting from the vaccinations including deaths
       *        4. social and development effects on young children
       * 5. the way in which the response to the pandemic was and the need to
       balance the
            response with advice from outside the medical profession
Lastly, there needs to be a public apology to all of the Australian Citizens who
exercised their Constitution right not to take the experiment vaccines [ proven] and
may be a nominal compensation for the abuse they suffered and the abuse of power
exercised by State Premiers.



RELIGION FAITH [Part 2]
Section 116 of our Constitution in line with the UN's Human rights provides for the
guarantee of Religious Freedom through out the Commonwealth.

The imposition of a compulsory mandate breached the Freedom of Choice of each and
every Citizen and ignored the separation of powers between the secular and the spiritual.

The imposition of penalties for those of us who decided to exercise our God given right of
freedom of choice was a despicable act which breached of our Constitution;

      • 1, the mandate was based on an experiment [ the then Health Minister the Hon
         Greg Hunt admitted this calling it the worlds great /biggest experiment” and thus
         breach international law stemming from the Nuremberg Trials.
       • 2. Though out the pandemic I was a volunteer Secretary of a Charity, and was
           forced work from home until it became unworkable and thus ended 11 years of
          continuous service to that organisation.
        * 3 As an member of the organising committee for a public monument to an
            Australia hero I was excluded from participating in the unveiling ceremony [ in
            the open air ] and where m^^^|anc^^^^H were in attendance which I
            found to be insulting.

My memory indicates that Sweden took a path of no vaccination which not only faired
better that Australia but also at a minimal cost.

We in Australia appeared to act in panic..

CONCLISION Part 2
All levels of Government need to exercise their powers within the constraints of the
Constitution.

There was supposedly a plan to cover this eventuality but was not opened or
followed.

The Plan needs to reviewed and updated and noting the limitations of the powers
within the Constitution

And the delegation of powers and the monitoring of those powers need to be
highlighted couples to the duties and responsibilities of each layer of government.

In this case the Commonwealth had the power and not the State but the
Commonwealth failed to monitor and control the situation
