Dear Committee Members
I would like to make some brief points for
Your consideration.

I strongly believe that the Federal and
State Governments' over reacted to the
covid 19 outbreak and these over
reactions seriously exacerbated the
difficulties that the Australian People
suffered. At times, heavy handed
measures caused an impost on
Australians with a noticeable negative
outcome - even considering some positive
effects on physical health, the mental and
emotional health of Our Elderly People,
particularly Those in aged care, suffered
greatly. Some died, Many lost hope in Their
long isolation and had Their lives
shortened. Many stories have been told to
Me about the onerous restrictions causing
once healthy Parents losing Their joy of
life and will to live because of Their forced
estrangement with Family and Friends.
Wrong balance? Way wrong. Never again.

People's rights to information and support
for Their decision to be vaccinated or not
was overridden, sometimes brutally - this
should never happen again. People must
be supported in Their personal decisions
and coercion and pressure must not be
instituted again - Equal Rights must be
supported and maintained by Every Effort
of Government.

Free, proper and open discussion must be
positively promoted by All Governments,
otherwise willing, informed participation
by People will not occur.

Small business Owners lost Their way of
life, Their financial livelihood, years of toil,
in enormous numbers due to excessive
Goverment action in closing whole classes
of businesses. The statistics won't fully
show the depth of the disastrous collapse
of small business.

I do call for a full Royal Commission into
the effects and reaction to the covid 19
disease.

Sincerely,
