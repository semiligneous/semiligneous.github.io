              Submission and Evidence to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Testimony by the Suspended Dr William Bay

15 December 2023

Background

I was a full-time 7-days-week medical practi tioner working in 3 different roles primarily in
                        at the time of and during the full extent of the Covid-19 pandemic
and the Australian Government’s response to it up until my suspension as an urgent after­
hours doctor, and a Telehealth                     doctor, and a
GP Registrar doctor on 17 August 2022.

I was indefinitely suspended on that day by the Medical Board of Australia (MBA), working
in conjunction with their administrative ami Ahpra (the Australian Health Practitioner
Regulation Agency) to enforce an emergency powers sl56 (under Queensland’s Health
Practitioner Regulation National Law) immediate action suspension to prohibit me working
in any job (doctor, administration, teacher or otherwise) that utilised my medical knowledge
until the MBA finds me no longer a threat to the public safety of Australians.

These agencies allege that I am a threat to Australia’s public safety because I chose to make
my own decisions about the quality of the Covid-19 vaccines, to disobey their directive to
never criticise the vaccine rollout program, and to actively and publicly warn others about the
risks I rightfully perceived. This is a position that I maintain is and was the correct and
moral duty of all health practitioners and far from being ashamed of it - I am proud of it.

One day after my MBA administrative hearing on 16 August 2022 (that I was not allowed to
attend in person or even online) as after being denied entry to the hearing I was then also
kicked out of the Zoom call as well (for having 450 public supporters standing behind me) -
the MBA and AHPRA found me guilty of 45 reasons for being a threat to Australia’s public
safety - thus al legedly justifying the exercise of their destructive power to suspend doctors
without a trial or due process indefinitely. These 45 reasons are attached and the details and
documents pertaining to my legal fight to restore my license and the right of all Australians to
informed consent and to have confidence in their health care system and their health
practitioners is well documented on my social medi^ccount^nd primarily at the website
^^^^^^^Hand the social media accounts of Dr                         on Facebook and Twitter/X.

I now remain suspended and without medical employed 17 months and counting - awaiting
for a report and a decision long promi sed to the Court from the Medical Board of Australi a as
to what justification they had in suspending me when all I was doing was trying to warn and
help others. When the report is finally provided to me, I shall clear my name in the courts
and together, as one, all Australians united under the banner of informed consent and
freedom of speech: we will win justice for all Covid-19 government victims.

Governance, including roles and responsibilities

The primary reason the MBA/Ahpra suspended me until this day is because I publicly
and vocally criticised the vaccines and the Government and its response to the
pandemic and its position on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout program. I had my career and
my income effectively and literally terminated overnight by an agency that was supposed to
be protecting public health but instead forcefully suppressing a doctor’s moral and legal
right and duty to warn his/her patients and the public about risks pertaining to the
Covid-19 virus, the vaccine and the Government’s response to the pandemic.

Ahpra and the Boards for all health practitioners continue until this very day to enforce
their free-speech suppressing 9 March 2021 “Position Statement - Registered health
practitioners and students and COVID-19 vaccination” found at
https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Search.aspx?q=covid-19+position+statement and attached) which
in my strong view (and a view that I am pursuing legally in the Supreme Court of Queensland
and the High Court of Australia via a judicial review of the unconstitutional Health
Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 Qld which purports to give Queensland state
legislative authority to allow Ahpra to administer a national scheme despite Queensland not
having national jurisdiction over our country.) is a position clearly against the Code of
Conduct for medical practitioners, the expectations of the public, and established High Court
case law and indeed statutory human rights and civil liability law. It is this position that has
damaged Australia’s response to the pandemic so critically, as it has broken the trust
average Australians have in the integrity and truthfulness of their health practitioners
as this position statement effectively forces doctors and nurses to lie to their patients.

Key health response measures

As one of the last remaining suspended doctors from the Covid-19 pandemic era; it is my
direct testimony that it is my belief and experience that my patients and members of the
public have been harmed and killed by the Covid-19 vaccines and Ahpra and the MBA
is firmly and directly responsible for those deaths by preventing the free expression of
medical advice which is a moral and legal duty to warn affirmed by the High Court (and
taught to us in medical school) in the 1992 High Court case of Rogers v Whitaker paragraphs
16-18 and reflected in the doctor’s Code of Conduct and the Immunisation Handbook as well.

Role of AHPRA impeding Australian health practitioner’s duty to provide informed
consent to patients and the public

I believe that the only way to prevent the negligent homicide of Australians in the future
by the corporate agency Ahpra (registered in Victoria but purporting to govern Australia),
an agency tasked to supposedly protect the public is to allow and affirm individual
health practitioners to fulfill their duty to warn their patients and the public about risks
of interventionist medical treatments, vaccines or otherwise.

To allow Ahpra to maintain their illegal ‘Position Statement’ is to undermine our democratic
and constitutional right to a freedom of political communication in this country. And it is also
a clear and present threat to the very lives, health, and safety of all Australians forever until
trust and sanity is restored to our medical system beginning with the complete dissolution
and destruction of Ahpra and the “National” Boards.

Trust and safety will only begin to be restored in Australia by the enactment of new laws
affirming health practitioners sacred right to freedom of speech and informed consent for
their patients.
