Statement of complaint and protest regarding the Covid response in Australia


I strongly protest the approaches both Federal and State governments took and the measures

they inflicted on the Australian populace in the name of a Covid pandemic. They abused our

human rights to bodily autonomy, freedom of speech, assembly, movement, association, and

employment. They incurred exorbitant debts and allowed China to profit from the production

of ludicrous amounts of ‘hygiene’ paraphernalia. They damaged business, industry, and supply

lines with lockdowns and vax mandates, and forced many people out of their jobs and hence

their homes. Much wealth flowed to large corporations at the expense of small to medium

businesses, financially harming many ‘middle class’ Australians who continue to suffer with

resulting high cost of living. I consider that a crime of massive proportions has been perpetrated

upon the Australian people, not only against our human rights and financial wellbeing, but also

against our health, physical and mental. Safe effective drugs like HCQ and IVM were banned

and the government worked with mainstream media to terrify the public with propaganda and

threats. Disastrous health results from the toxic components of the Covid vaccines continue

and increase, and I fear for the longterm health of family members and friends who succumbed

to the abusive government campaign. I will never forget or forgive the evil acts forced upon

us, and insist that a proper independent enquiry be made to restore justice by prosecuting the

culprits.
