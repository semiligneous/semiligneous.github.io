To Whom it may concern

   This is my submission on how the covid crisis has impacted my life personally.
     My employment was negatively impacted because I chose not participate, in a vaccine
that I felt was not yet adequately tested. My employer mandated that all employees had to
be fully vaccinated by February 2021.1 feel the government failed to protect my freedom of
medical choice and privacy by failing to enact anti discrimination legislation to protect my
freedom of choice, bodily autonomy and medical privacy.
   With all peer reviewed data now widely available, I feel I made the correct decision. I feel
my government failed me terribly.
