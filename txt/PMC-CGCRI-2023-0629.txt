It was a disgusting breach of human rights to enforce vaccine mandates.

It was clear from the outset that the vaccines did not stop transmission of coronavirus and they did not stop
people getting sick. Very few people under the age of about 60 died or even required hospital care as a result of
getting coronavirus. Mandating an ineffective jab to keep one's job (and to go to Bunnings) was a disgrace.

It was also a disgrace to demand that people who had already contracted the virus still get jabbed.

Even more absurd (and bordering on criminal) was enforcing a mandate when the recipient of a jab developed
myocarditis or some other serious side effect.

Australian were told what to do and what they couldn't do based on "health advice" but there was precious little
actual science in the health advice. Did the scientific research really say that if you've already had coronavirus it
would still be beneficial to get jabbed? Did the scientific research really say that if you got myocarditis after your
first jab that you were still better off if you got a second jab and that it would be dangerous to the community to
have you at work if you didn't get a second jab? Did the scientific research really say that 20-year-olds benefitted
from being jabbed?

The vaccine mandates were an appalling breach of power by governments.
