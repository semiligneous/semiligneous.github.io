I think it is extremely important to have an inquiry into the federal response to the
pandemic.

There is so much that needs to be addressed. The government's disproportionate response,
eg. mask mandates, lockdowns, vaccine mandates, official misinformation and lies in the
media that the vaccines were safe and effective, vaccine injuries, media censorship,
silencing of doctors, the role of AHPRA AND ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors,
poor treatment of victims.

Many Australians are still suffering in some way as a result of how this was handled by the
government. Eg. Loss of employment, high suicide rates, vaccine injuries, discrimination of
those who for various reasons decided not to take it, etc.

In a democratic nation this should never have happened and hopefully an inquiry will help
prevent Australia for making the same mistakes in a future pandemic.
