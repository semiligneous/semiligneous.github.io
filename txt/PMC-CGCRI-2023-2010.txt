The Government didn't control any part of the response to Covid. They passed it onto the State Govts.
So there was no unity or compatibility. The response was over the top, brutal, and totally wrong.

There should NOT have been State lock downs/outs. The police abused there powers, were breaking the
Law in the way they were acting and treating people, as we are now seeing from Court cases being
thrown out by Judges.

The States should not have stopped people returning to their homes.
