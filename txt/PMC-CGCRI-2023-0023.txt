I'm an educated financial planner with^^^^^^^^experience giving advice, analyzing statistics,
with a                                                         followed the reported statistics
throughout the Covid period with concern about media inflammation on the topic and the lack of
specific data reporting publicly, although information was provided here: COVID-19 reporting |
Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care. Fear was an outcome obtained and the
bullying of the Australian public by State and Federal governments was not in the interest of
individuals. The inaccurate reporting is concerning, so too was the single treatment response
advocated, along with the ineffective government stimulus program. Many questions are asked in
this submission to drive conversation on risk / return and who really was most at risk, as I don't want
to see Australian's bullied into a single health response in the future. "Stay Safe" was the mantra of
the day for a flu, termed Covid-19, Coronavirus based, novel in nature, a flu type virus which the
world has encountered in the past and will encounter in the future. This has been the case for
thousands of years, we live with many viruses, most are harmless otherwise we would already all be
dead!

Statistics are information used to infer relevance and particularly so in finance, with a risk / return
tradeoff, which can be applied to health. How many times were questions raised about the accuracy
of the reported Covid death figures? "Did he die with Covid, or from Covid" was common,
particularly by families with elderly parents passing, with 2.5+ co-morbid conditions, though preÂ­
existing health information wasn't reported. The information I collated was based on Covid-19
website reported numbers, though I believe these to be at best overinflated, and uninteresting
modest when compared to historical flu / pneumonia deaths, as reported by the Australian Bureau
of Statistics (ABS), which in 2018: https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-
2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-case-numbers-and-statistics

was 3,102.

By the 19/3/2022 total Covid deaths were 5,397 since the "pandemic" commenced early 2020,
though the ABS figure is for a 12-month period. Why was this pandemic reported on everyday by
state leaders as so deadly, with the ONLY health recommendation t get vaccinated? Attempting to
vaccinate against virus that would look different in me than you, with the same approach is an
unintelligent approach to health. Why was the Australian public told to have the "safe and effective"
vaccine, as it stops transmission, sorry, reduces symptoms, though so too would vitamin C. Billions
have taken an experimental vaccine approved for emergency use after discrediting decades long
established, Nobel prize winning alternatives including Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine. What
due diligence did the Australian State and Federal governments take to support this approach? I
am pro science, though there were no randomized double-blind placebo-controlled gold standard
studies on non-liability pharmaceutical companies, why?

The Australian public was bullied with limited information, forced to stay at home, give up
employment if not vaccinated, facing^Jambasting that "no one forced you to get vaccinated".
There was no choice for most as large corporates required vaccination for employee's, how is that
legal, and then other sectors such as health cry out for workers they just fired! What protections will
the government put in place to provide freedom of medical choice? Policies aren't levied against
political, sexual, and religious beliefs yet, so will the Australian public lose their health autonomy
under the premise of "safe and effective" in the future?

Herd immunity is a positive consequence of living in a society and the information clearly highlights who was most likely to die from Covid-19, the elderly.
Though schools were closed, businesses were shut down, and then $320 million dollars was printed and pumped into the economy inefficiently, increasing
national debt by 60% and creating inflationary pressures over time through an increased money supply. Australian's were bullied out of a job and into a
forced medical procedure when the majority of the workforce, under 60 years of age, accounted for less than 10% of total Covid deaths! Why wasn't this
information communicated to the Australian public to provide context that deaths were mostly in the elderly, you know with on average more than 2.5
co-morbid conditions?

I saw lives ruined financially and then medically, as personal health has deteriorated following the receipt of an experimental vaccine, requiring the
cessation of employment, exercise even due to heart related conditions. The whole Covid-19 charade was at the expense of the Australian people, where
the survival rate of Covid was 98.98%, with the average age of death being 80.65. Only 10% of deaths related to 60-69-year-olds, with 82.84% of deaths in
individuals over age 70, though an entire workforce was sent home. What psychological health issues have been forced upon the entire nation when the
survival rate was 99%?

In summary, reported information should be accurate and communicated appropriately by the media, this data should include a summary of the individual's
death and pre-existing conditions. Medical treatments require gold standard assessment prior to "forced" distribution, this is required and involve
independent, unbiased, non-conflicted medical professionals from around the world. A 60% increase to national debt to address a problem the government
created should not have occurred, the economy should never go into lock down again, particularly as those at risk are retired.
