Submission: Australian Federal COVID-19 Response Inquiry


I am providing this submission as a concerned citizen. I was deeply affected by the
Australian pandemic response and am skeptical as to what this inquiry will achieve. Some of
the concerns and questions I would like explored are listed below.
   1. Considering the scale and impact of the pandemic response, why is a royal
      commission not being held?
   2. How can you hold a serious and comprehensive inquiry into the pandemic response
      in Australia without including the actions of the states?
   3.      The formation, operation and lack of transparency of the national cabinet.
   4. The extremely narrow and inadequate Covid-19 Vaccine Injury Compensation
      Scheme. The government signed contracts giving the vaccine manufacturers
      immunity from liability yet those injured/killed by the vaccines canâ€™t easily access
      compensation (or at levels they deserve).
   5. The Federal Government did nothing to protect Australians from the actions of the
      states. These actions, including things like mandatory vaccination (even for non-high-
      risk activities such as volunteer wildlife rescue in Victoria!), border closures etc. had
      extreme and damaging consequences for people all over Australia.
   6. Why were doctors not allowed to use professional judgement regarding vaccinations
      and exemptions?
   7. The extreme/excessive/demeaning language used by government at all levels and
      the media around Covid and those who had concerns about the Covid-19 vaccines.
   8. Spending and wastage of public funds on expired vaccines, medicines, PRE, RATs
      etc.
   9. Secrecy around vaccine and other agreements despite being paid for with taxpayer
      money.


Thank you for your consideration.
