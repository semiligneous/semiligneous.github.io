To COVID-19 Response Inquiry Panel,

I am writing to request a full Royal Commission for a proper investigation into:

    •         Vaccine procurement and the parties who benefited financially from the deals,
    •         Vaccine contracts and their terms and conditions,
    •         Vaccine mandates with the proof that they would work and who made the decisions,
    •    Vaccine injuries, the tracking mechanisms and why the vaccine injuries compensation scheme was not
         updated to include the latest adverse reactions,
    •         Mask mandates and lockdowns with the proof that they would work and who made the decisions,
    •    Government misinformation in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block infection and
         transmission along with denial of vaccine injuries and gaslighting of the injured,
    •    The AHPRA lack of due diligence on safety, their silence on undeniable harm of the vaccine and their
         action along with ATAGI to silence the Medical Profession,
    •    Who decided to do the opposite of the 2019 Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic
         Influenza, which prophetically described why all of the actions the Government did take would not work
         and would cause hardship



The disruption to our lives was unwarranted and continues to this day. The actions of the Government led to an
increased divide in our communities, pitting family member against family member, work colleague against work
colleague, friend against friend, and stranger against stranger.

A Royal Commission will help to identify the parties involved and why these decisions were made, and allow us
to better determine the right path forward should there be another pandemic or emergency in the future.

We cannot allow these actions to occur again. Australia is worse-off because of the decisions made during the
COVID-19 pandemic response, and it is only by investigating and publishing the truth of what happened that we
can learn from the mistakes and secure a better pandemic/emergency response for the future.



Thank you your consideration.
