SUBMISSON TO COVID RESPONSE ENQUIRY - David Warth


The Australian governments Covid response was totally disproportionate to the level of risk.
Scott Morrison publicly stated accurately that for 8 out of 10 people Covid would be a mild
disease.
This was then contradicted by a government response calling for an 80% vaccination rate.
This would suggest the intervention of individuals or organisations acting to change government
policy regarding the health response.
This brings the whole response into question and suggests that the whole process was influenced
and compromised. This must be investigated thoroughly and a Royal Commission with broad
ranging powers is required to determine what actually led to the adoption of such a drastic
response.
The brutal implementation of government health orders such as lockdowns, mask and
vaccination mandates by employers must never be allowed to happen again.
If these measures are reimposed in the future there will be every chance of massive civil unrest
and it would be a fool hardy government to consider these options.
The world witnessed a side of Australia's supposed democratic system that was a national
disgrace with brutality that shocked viewers everywhere.
The Covid injections were fraudulently claimed to be safe and effective. They were not
adequately tested and should never have been allowed for use in Australia in any manner.


The Australian government needs to be aware of the influences that shaped Covid policy.
We are told that future pandemics are inevitable and there are questions to be answered around
this assumption and what organisations and individuals stand to gain from this.
The Australian people have been stressed to breaking point by the Governments Covid response
and there is widespread scepticism about the whole thing.
