I am^^ears old and have an athletic/sporting background going back almost to the time I began to
walk! It is time for the truth to be told and adequately publicised concerning Covid 19 vaccine
efficacy and vaccine injuries. Like many people, I have suffered for the last 2 years from the effects
of 3 covid vaccinations. There are others I have known that have suffered both similar and different
vaccine injuries that are far worse than mine.

After numerous tests by various specialists, all my doctors have agreed that my very rapid loss of
strength and endurance can be best described as vaccine injury by exclusion. Exclusion because
their testing can find nothing obviously wrong with my health but I describe my situation thus
                         My athletic performance records (specifically long-distance running) over the
last     ears support this and my doctor's conclusions.

I will say a strong NO to any further mRNA vaccination, NO to mandates, NO to lockdowns, NO to
WHO vaccine passports and any other forms of dictatorship by WHO or any other unelected body.
