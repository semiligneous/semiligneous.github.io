Draft

  My name is Michael.

  I am a NSW citizen who is writing to express my concerns over how the Covid-19 response was handled by the Governments
  and Police Forces in Australia.

  In direct response to your "scope".

  1. The fact that every state and territory made up their own rules is proof that everyone was just making these tyrannical rules
  up! There was no evidence or studies that backed any rules implemented.

  2. Masks do not protect anyone from anything so stop pushing the lies! There is no hermetic seal with a surgical mask. The
  particles we breath out are smaller than asbestos. So why would you use a surgical mask to protect yourself from airborne
  particles that are smaller than asbestos? You would not use these masks to protect you from asbestos. No science, just lies.
  Scott Morrison and Greg Hunt had no authority to waste the massive amounts of money to purchase ineffective vaccines that
  caused damage and not protection. One of my work colleagues died, and                is still suffering the effects of the Pfizer
  vaccine. Another work colleague of mine experienced heart palpitations but never got it checked. His girlfriend was officially
  diagnosed with myocarditis. Yes she took Pfizer! Doctor tried to say it was from her previous^^^^^^^ condition? How
  dumb do these doctors think we are. These doctors are criminals too!

  3. The lock-downs were destructive for business, the economy and the public moral as a whole. It was illegitimate, dictatorial
  mandates from power hungry maniacs who put all these tyrannical rules in place which did nothing but destroy the fabric of
  our society. These measures put in place by all governments increased suicides. Go look up the data. The two tiered rules in
  relation to "essential" and "non-essential" workers was absolute garbage. No ones job is "non-essential". And Police and
  Politicians are definitely not "essential". And the rules around smaller businesses not being allowed to operate but Woolworths,
  Coles and Bunnings being allowed to still trade was criminal! Not being allowed to travel more than 5 kilometres "without
  permission" or get a $5000 fine? Being harassed and abused by police, children and elderly being pepper sprayed, shot with
  rubber bullets? These are the actions of dictatorships andregimes not democratically elected Governments in the
  Western World! Or do we actually live in a covert ^^^^^Istate? Vaccine passports to gain entry to businesses was
  criminal. Is it still not illegal to disclose a persons medical status? So why was it ok, and "mandatory" for strangers to know my
  medical status during this period!

  4. The commonwealth government had no right to close the borders and to not allow citizens to return. This was criminal.

  5, 6. If government did not implement these ridiculous rules supports such as job keeper etc would not have been required.
  These actions of money printing by the Government and the RBA to feign supporting the Australian Public, small businesses
  and the economy is what caused the inflation we are experiencing now. These financial supports were not required if the
  government did not force businesses to close their doors and dismiss their staff. The answer is clear, do not do this again. Do
  not for this tyranny on the Australian people again.

  If you want evidence look at the New Zealand Health Department data where the Database Administratoi^^^^^^|showed
  clear evidence that the vaccines kill. He is now arrested. You need to ask yourself why, and have your analysts which we pay
  for do the proper data analysis on the information you have collated over the last 3 years and you will find the same. NSW
  health data shows this as well. Overall cause mortality rates have risen after the rolllout of the vaccines. How can it be, that
  the "flu" disappeared in 2020 and 2021?

  The below screenshot is taken from the NSW Health Department document which can be found here:
  https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/lnfectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20231021.pdf

  Look at how much deaths increased in 2021 and 2022 when the vaccines were rollout out, not in 2020 when the supposed
  "most virulent and deadly" strain of the "Covid-19 Virus" was going around. The data speaks for itself. Look at 2017! There
  were no lock-downs vaccine passports or mandatory vaccines or border closures then?

    Death surveillance
    All-cause mortality
    All-cause mortality provides a comprehensive measure of total impact of health threats, such as severe influenza
    period, COVID-19 and heatwaves, by counting both deaths directly attributable and indirectly associated with the
    threat. Monitoring all-cause mortality allows rapid assessment of changing patterns of mortality, and whether the
    number of deaths in a period is more or less than expected. In this report mortality is determined from counts of
    deaths in the NSW Registry of Births Deaths & Marriages. The rate of death per week is presented with the seasonal
    baseline, which summarises the historic (2017-2021) rate of deaths for corresponding week (red dashed line, grey
    shading indicates the 95% confidence interval). This indicator provides a signal of the impact from any significant
    and prolonged cause on the NSW population.

    Interpretation: Weekly lag adjusted all-cause mortality is within the usual variation.

    Notes:

    In this report, due to the time interval between a death occurring and the date on which the death is registered, only
    deaths reported 4 weeks prior to the date of analysis are used. Deaths are lag adjusted for the weeks ending 20
    August 2023 to 24 September 2023. For additional information see data sources and methods for details.

I raised concerns about how the government has behaved over the last two years in relation to health care.
How people were forced to have vaccines. I raised concerns with people that I personally know that have had life threatening
effects frorMhese^^Hinjections. One                       of mine passed away. He had a heart attack after the second injection.
He went to^^HHospital. Had another 4 consecutive heart attacks and was then in a coma for the rest of his life. I did not
get a chance to say my goodbye to him whilst he was still alive because of the ridiculous rules put in place in hospitals. And
still there are ridiculous rules where nurses and doctors are forced to wear masks, forced to keep updated with the deadly
vaccines. For no good reason. There is no proof that masks stop the spread of anything There is no evidence to show that the
vaccines "stop the spread"? There is no hermetic seal with a surgeon mask, therefore it does not stop micro particles at all.

Anyway, back to                                    god rest his soul. He did not want to take the jab, but because he was a
casual at the company I work for, he knew that they would not put him back on, once Sydney opened back up with the
restrictions of havincU^ho^^^ertificat^malac^AnothenTiad^ui^^l^^aoliticians and bureaucrats. He told me his
manager                                                                               Can you believe that this came out of a
managers mout^^B^ntuitio^wa^gnt^uun^aecisio^n^maae^ause^i^meave us too soon. We never went in a
motobike ride togetnen

So, being in a coma for almost 4 months, his parents and partner had to deal with the decision of turning off his life support.
So on the recommendations of the doctors! The same doctors who say the vaxx is safe and effective! His poor parents were
advised to turn his life support off. He passed away                                                        The Government
took your life. What a decision to have to make. I bet no politician had to make this decision because they didn't get the real
full dose of the jab H

Then I have                       who I almost lost. The trauma                                                   had to go through dealing with it is irreparable!


      Yet after the second death jab, he developed clots in the lungs 4 weeks after. He was coughing up blood at home! If
     was not there, he would have done what most male men do and not do anything. We could have lost him! |


The family GP recommended to him that he take the Pfizer injection               to take the Astra Zeneca.
did not provide |           [with informed consent. The doctor here has                                     a health practitioner. He
was admitted to               hospital. Scans revealed clotting                                            Then, to treat the clots,
they put him on blood thinner tablets that are manufactured by Pfizer! Is this some sort of sick joke!? The lung specialist!
       at              Hospital does not know what caused the clot, in spite of_hi    re-existing condition! She didn't report it as
a possible link to the deadly vaccine jab! I went with^^^^Hto see the GP                                        2 weeks after for a
follow up after being released from               Hospital. I knew   would not speak up. I sent an email               advising that
I would be attending, ^■did not turn up that day, instead                     to see dad . I recorded the whole conversion if you
want proof. He asked me why I wasn't wearing a mask in the surgery. I told him I do not have to as it does not protect me from
anything and that if he does not like it he can call the police.

Due to the damage done by the blood clots^^^^^^| he has reduced lung capacity. At the time there were the stupid
mandates where the government was still "mandating" that masks still be worn. I asked Dr^^^Hto write dad an mask
exemption due to his reduced lung capacity. He refused! I asked him how could he not write^^an exemption, seeing that his
lungs are damaged due to the pc     ind misleading advice                                 ? His response to        was "I
don't want you to catch covid"??7^^Bexplained to him thaHi^iOn^niar^^reath^ust walking around                         let
alone with one. He eventually agreed to write ■ an exemption.

Should it really be this hard if the doctor was following his oath in his duty of care to his patient to do no harm? I want to know
what you think? This is the medical system the Australian Government and Bureaucrats have created. It has become a farce.
It has been hijacked by these drug producing companies that leach off the medicare system. If all these so called
professionals are getting paid from my hard earned tax dollars then I do not want to contribute to these glorified drug dealers
any more! I want my taxes back.

This is another solution I offer to you. Give me my taxes back for unauthorized expenditure by politicians and bureaucrats who
are in abuse of office which is treason. I then asked the doctor if he was going to report it as a possible adverse reaction? He
said no and refused to do it for a good 10 minutes explaining that blood clots are not linked to the Pfizer lethal injection. I told
him, we are not leaving until he does so.

Again, if he was looking after the best interests of his patient, why would he behave in this manner? Is it because the TGA and
AHPRA sent threatening communications to GP's Australia wide advising that if they did not tow the Government lie they
would be stripped of the license to practice medicine?
Is he being coerced by a higher power?

What would drive this evil and malevolent behaviour?
                                                                                               Something for you to contemplate.

He eventually did put the report in but I did notice that the form asked the question do you believe the issue was caused by the
vaccine. I watch him change his answer from yes to no.



Needles to say my Father was advised that he would have to take these^^^pill indefinitely which was prescribed by Dr
    |the lung specialist at           Hospital. She also refused to report this as a lossible adverse reaction to the
vaccination. KSMBffSM

Dr^^^l advisecHriwfatheMne can stop taking the Pfizer drugs                             sure enough^^|had to go to
hospital again                  for clotting in the lungs again. Thi^im^i^^nHo^^^^| Hospital. This new lung specialist
seemed interested in taking on ^^flcase and asked questions like "did the previous specialist^^^^^H      determine
what cause the issue?". He seemed promising and might be a real doctor who would look intocondition and try to find
out what the root cause is. I was curious myself and wanted to meet this doctor.

This doctor saw              swollen feet, did not recommend to do any scans or tests. Was not prepared for the consultation,
he rang for reports from the hospital whilst we were in his office, listening to him r the phone. He had no facts with him from
the blood tests taken whr          /as resubmitted to hospital. He prescribed ^^^^Hthe same Pfizer anti-blood clot drugs,
again! And said I will see you in 6 months? Is this how the medical system works?

The medical system needs a massive overhaul as to me it appears to be captured by the big drug companies.

Attached for your reference is the report from when my father was first admitted.
