           Submission for the COVID-19
             Response Inquiry Panel
My name is Gaetan Selle, I am a permanent resident in Australia and I work in video
production. I have been thinking a lot about global catastrophic risks from nuclear war,
artificial intelligence and biorisks are definitely high on my list of concerns.

My submission underscores the importance of Australia's shift towards a proactive stance in
preventing future pandemics, rather than exclusively concentrating on preparedness. As a
resident of Australia, I experienced the profound disruption that COVID-19 wrought upon my
life, mirroring the experiences of countless others. It impeded not only my professional
endeavors and interpersonal connections but also served as a stark reminder that COVID-19
was, in many ways, a mere dress rehearsal for a far graver threat. The contemplation of how
drastically life could have been altered had the mortality rate surged to a harrowing 50% is a
haunting prospect that underscores the urgency of our preventative measures.

Surely this investigation should analyze all avenues for the administration to better assist
citizens in the next pandemic. However, even a well-managed pandemic brings awful
outcomes. Hence, deterrence should be the main ambition.

I know Australia invests heavily in mitigating natural disasters, increasing due to climate
change. But I am unaware of similar efforts to curb pandemics, despite higher average risk
for Australians.


The risk of engineered pandemic
In that framework, I want to surface important issues to steer us appropriately. One
prevention area demanding more gravity is the expanding prospect of man-made
pandemics. The inquiry's scope focuses on expecting pandemics. Evidence shows
effectively doing so necessitates weighing this possibility.

Experts, including MIT Professor Kevin Esvelt, assess that the technologies necessary to
design, create and release dangerous and novel pathogens may become widely available by
2025.

A technology enabling millions of potential casualties in the wrong hands is clearly
unacceptable. Recognizing this danger, President Biden ordered new rules on October 30th,
2023. His executive order mandates developing a framework within 180 days to effectively
screen risky DMA orders, institute access controls, provide technical screening guidance,
and oversight. Currently, about 20% of DMA requests go unvetted. The order also threatens
to cut funds to any provider not following the forthcoming best practices after the 180-day
deadline.
Australia already regulates importing synthetic DNA. This investigation should advise the
government to urgently update that system to align with the US rules. That means requiring
Australian labs importing DNA to check all orders under the new American procedures.

Following the US DNA regulations would largely address the most pressing risks experts like
Professors Esvelt and Schmidt raise. But it is not a permanent fix. Ongoing biotechnology
advances and more sophisticated Al could help bad actors circumvent these regulations
unless rules keep pace. Safety measures for Al must also advance.

Thus, this inquiry should recommend the Industry Department collaborate with Health and
the CDC. Together they can develop minimum safety standards for frontier Al models
deployed in Australia. The goal is to identify and restrict models that pose biosafety dangers.
We should clearly tell developers and users that Al with potential "dual-use" catastrophes
risks is unwelcome here. Finally, we must closely track progress in biotechnology to prevent
engineering pathogens from becoming widely feasible.


Lab leak will probably be the source of the next pandemic
High incident rates in labs handling hazardous pathogens shocked me. A Manheim and
Lewis study found 71 reported cases of risky human-created pathogen exposures from
1975-2016, likely underreported. An anonymous Belgian survey uncovered nearly 100
lab-acquired infections over 5 years. A lab leak also may have sparked the 1977 flu
pandemic. (https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/7aBE8dl)

Given pandemics can destroy millions of lives and trillions in wealth, current safety measures
seem inadequate. While science drives progress fighting pandemics, responsibility matters.

As an outsider, oversight of Australian containment facilities seems opaque. The Gene
Technology Regulator focuses largely on GMOs, revealing little about facilities.

Available data shows the Regulator certified a record 132 facilities last fiscal year, reaching
1,874 "high-level" labs now operating. Yet only 49 inspections occurred, none examining the
highest-tier PC4 facilities. Reviews show no PC4 inspections for the past 3 years, with just
one in 2020-2021. Despite so few reviews, 26 certified facilities showed noncompliance. The
report called this a “cooperative approach”, finding no fault.

Additionally, facility guidelines seem outdated. PC4 rules date back to 2007, referencing air
filter and lab safety standards untouched since the early 2000s. One filter standard drew
HVAC industry criticism for relying on inaccurate 1950s research, now superseded.

While an unflattering portrait, this may simply reflect limited resources. The Regulator has
just 51 staff across diverse oversight duties. Overall though, regulation seems to fall short of
public expectations. I would have assumed facilities meet cutting-edge global standards,
with multiple yearly inspections.

I think that this Inquiry should recommend a thorough review of biosafety - including the
suitability of requirements, degree of adherence, and adequacy of oversight - for all
research that involves human or animal pathogens. The review should include a risk
assessment that takes into account the potentially catastrophic global consequences of
errors, and ensures that our approach to mitigation is proportionate to that risk.


Preventing social collapse
Modern society depends on electricity from interconnected grids powering water,
communications, transport, healthcare, and more. Today's grids need endless diligence,
where health crises limiting staff could spur catastrophic collapse. Addressing this jeopardy
satisfies Inquiry priorities one, two, and six.

A paper by Wormuth et al note COVID-19 differed from past outbreaks with higher elderly
mortality. Younger employees predominantly staff essential grid operations. Future
pandemics impacting youngergroups more severely might devastate infrastructure in ways
impossible without tightly optimized, fragile systems. Thus, they contend safeguarding the
power network amid contagions is critical.

Accordingly, I advise this investigation recommend Supply Chain Resilience, Home Affairs
Critical Infrastructure, and Emergency Management collaborate. They can devise
preparation and response plans for pandemics disrupting supply chains and provoking staff
scarcities in vital sectors.

Wormuth et al and Gopal et al's paper "Securing Civilization Against Catastrophic
Pandemics" offer specifics. That includes robust contingency schemes for generators,
transmitters, and distributors - plus capacity to provide high-grade protective equipment and
other safeguards for workers during crises. Given the importance of reaffirming confidence,
industry engagement and public transparency seem key across governmental plans and
simulations.

Throughout the annals of history, the domain of public health has undergone a profound
expansion. An observer from bygone eras might have dismissed the significance of
innovations like the advent of microscope lenses, the intricacies of sewer infrastructure, the
introduction of citrus fruits aboard seafaring vessels, or myriad other advancements as
unrelated to the realm of public health. However, this relentless broadening of the public
health purview, embracing emerging challenges and novel technologies, has unequivocally
yielded significantly improved outcomes.

The present inquiry presents a unique opportunity to elevate nascent and contemporary
issues to the forefront of our considerations regarding pandemics. Whether it entails
harnessing the potential of metagenomic sequencing or addressing the perils associated
with artificial intelligence, I firmly believe that this investigation must delve into the
forthcoming risks and prospects that lie on the horizon of the 21st century.
