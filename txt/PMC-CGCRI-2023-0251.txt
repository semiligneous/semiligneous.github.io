To whom it may concern

I have watched from the very beginning how the covid narrative played out.
As I'm now anaphylactic thanks to the flu vaccine back in 2014, I was told by the emergency
department dr not to get any more vaccines as my chances of more severe anaphylaxis increase
significantly.
My dr of 30 yrs argued I didn't have a reaction so I went to freedom of information^^^^Hfor my
medical records for that day.
She then said I had to have one but she didn't know which one. I told her I've been reading
everything coming out of the USA and uk. I said I won't be taking any of that poison.
I asked for an exemption and she said she couldn't give one and also each year I got an exemption for
the flu shot no problem until COVID hit.
The government forgets what people are taught in healthcare and we knew what was happening was
absolutely ridiculous rubbish.
I had my workplace zoom me 3 times asking " give me a reason to not sack you", I said it's an
experimental jab and I won't participate, mandates aren't law and I refuse to go along with it so I will
resign.
I watched my kids get jabbed and my twin boys both hadThey hate going to the
doctor now because the government told them to say it's just anxiety any problem they had- one
also has
My daughter^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Band has days where she
             She was never like that before.
I watched my clients have fear in their eyes as they couldn't see family, us carers put a stop to that
and explained what was happening so they started refusing to follow the plan.
Australia already has a pandemic plan this was put aside for the outside entities to get into our
country, the WEF and WHO.
No one will conform next time the government tries this rubbish.
Same with the climate crisis, come on this is about making people rich and poor poorer.
Get rid of these outside entities and let the people govern our country.
We don't have a shortage of anything.
Stop the depopulation and food shortages
Drop the renewables right now, we the people aren't falling for it as we can crunch the numbers too,
it just won't work.
Small pockets of places sure but not the whole country.
