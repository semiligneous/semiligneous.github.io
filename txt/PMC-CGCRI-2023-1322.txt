To the covid inquiry,

I'm writing this submission regarding the trashing of privacy, laws & constitutional protections by
bureaucracy, gov both state & federal & private companies. Human rights abandoned, bodily
autonomy, lack of informed consent ignored, censorship of ANY information or questions against the
gov mantras & other treatment options to an experimental gene therapy slandered & berated.

None of this behavior is acceptable in a democracy, which makes me wonder just how far has this
country been dragged into socialism. National cabinet already having no standing as judged by the
high court, but the above matters emanated from this entity. There has been ZERO transparency,
ZERO acknowledgement of the harm caused by these decisions.

We already had a sufficient pandemic policy BEFORE this arrived which was also tossed aside.

I have never been so disgusted in the Australian political systems, fed, state & local at the total
disregard for protections written in law for the Australian community, that these entities saw fit to
trample, bully, threaten, punish to force an unproven chemical cocktail on the populous &
punishments still persist as do discriminations.

Yours Sincerely,

Lyndell Laws.
