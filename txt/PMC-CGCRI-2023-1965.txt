Commonwealth Government Covid 19 Response Inquiry                                            15/12/23

I’m a NSW Iteacher working for                                      as a                 teacher. In 2021
I lost my job as a result of the draconian vaccine mandates introduced by the NSW government. Had the
Federal government introduced anti-discrimination legislation such as the COVID-19 Vaccination Status
(Prevention of Discrimination) Bill 2022 and the Fair Work Amendment (Prohibiting COVID-19 Vaccine
Discrimination) Bill 2023, I would still have been able to work.

I sought an exemption because, as I already suffer with                             I was advised by my doctor
that any of the jabs may exacerbate my issue and I didn’t want to take the risk. It is frankly unconscionable
that the federal government did not protect the free choices of Australians to decide whether to undergo a
medical treatment, especially since Australians are protected from discrimination on so many other grounds.
And especially in light of the evidence that these ‘vaccines’ neither prevent transmission, or people get sick
and even dying from covid.

The purpose of this inquiry is to learn and thus improve Australia’s preparedness for future pandemics The
federal government and its departments cannot learn anything unless they first recognise and then
acknowledge the errors that have killed people, ruined lives and wasted billions. Instead, they are seeking to
censor discussion.1

Once policy gains momentum it is difficult to change because people’s egos are invested. The Permanent
Canberra bureaucracy ignored opinions that challenged or threatened their covid policies. The public service
is populated at the top by a milieu of closely connected people who reinforce eactwlheNHoecame an echo
chamber tainted by corporate influence. They made every mistake detailed                           in The
Psychology of Human Misjudgement^ including confirmation bias and commitment-and-consistency bias.
The urge to conform and defer to authority were weaponised with propaganda and censorship to ram
through unethical policies that are still killing people. This inquiry must challenge past assumptions. The
government must hold the bureaucracy to account: sack and criminally prosecute individuals where needed,
regardless of seniority, and never again treat dissent with censorship.

Term of reference: Key health response measures (COVID-19 vaccinations and public health
messaging). I have lost count of the friends and friends of friends who have been injured by the covid gene­
vaccines. These injuries range from myocarditis and heart attacks, cerebral haemorrage leading to death, to


cases. Most of these injuries were reported by doctors for investigation, and many were even denied to be
related initially, but then on investigation found to be related.

I now help                                  a memorial which displays the stories of more than 500 jab-injured
people who have been ignored and suppressed.(4) Every time, passers-by tell their own stories of injury, of
themselves or the people they know. This is an iatrogenic disaster worse than thalidomide, forced on us by
the Federal Government. We were led to believe the gene-vaccines were harmless, would stay in the
injection site, protect us from covid and reduce transmission. None of this was true - and this was obvious
from the start. The gene-vaccines are an entirely new class of medication. They are nothing like conventional
vaccines which deliver an exact dose of dead antigen and take 10 to 15 years to test. (5 )They had several
components never before used at scale in humans such as modified mRNAand lipid nanoparticles. It is not
possible to exactly measure the dose because your own cells might produce a lot or a little of the antigen,
and for an unknown amount of time. Vaccinal spikes have been found in the blood six months after injection.
6

The design invites auto-immune problems and inflammation because it tricks your own cells into expressing
a nonhuman spike protein on the surface. This provokes your immune system to attack your own body. The
Pfizer/Moderna synthetic lipid nanoparticle delivery system was designed to take cancer drugs across the
bloodbrain barrier, so of course they didn’t just stay in the arm. Pfizer’s own Nonclinical Evaluation Report for
Comirnaty submitted to the TGA in January 2021 shows they went everywhere in the body including the
brain, liver, heart, lungs, spleen and adrenal glands, and concentrated in the ovaries. (7)

Despite being high-risk and thus needing more safety testing than normal, these products were barely tested
at all. Pfizer (8) and Moderna ended the large-scale trials that were supposed to last two years after just 2
months by destroying the control group (9). If the mRNA causes an increased rate of cancer or heart attacks
at six months, there’s nobody to compare it to and you won’t know. The Phase III trials for AstraZeneca,
Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen were not even desiqnecR^eshHh^oroducts could interrupt transmission or
reduce severe covid symptoms, as noted by^^^^^H^^^^Hin October 2020.(10)


       was so alarmed by the poor design of the BNT162b clinical trials that he petitioned the European
Medicine^oenc^i^^ecembei^O^^skin^herTn^TalUh^nal^mmediatel^endin^Bvie^^^^M

                                    He was right, but drug-pushers demonised him as an “anti-vaxxer”, and he
was never heard from on mainstream media again. He became so terrified by this that he later concluded it
 must be an intentional plan to hurt people. These poorly-designed, truncated large-scale trials were not even
 done on the product we got. The cheap and scaled-up manufacturing process used to make the Pfizer gene­
 vaccine given to the public was entirely different to the PCR process used to make the gene-vaccine in the
 large clinical trials. We got a product cooked up in huge vats of antibiotic resistant e.coli bacteria. Pfizer
 tested this process on just 250 participants. (12) This process contaminated the products with endotoxins
 along with fragments of mRNAand DNA.(13) Pfizer declared Comirnaty “95% effective” in November 2020
 because it produced antibodies in the blood.(14) But these antibodies do no^rotec^o^^he^^TO^_
 stimulate mucosal immunity - and you catch covid through your mucosa,
^^^Hexplains. (15) The covid gene-vaccines were all given provisional registration, a category invented in
 201816 to allow products to be sold to the public for up to six years before the safety testing required for full
 authorisation is finished.(17) The TGAs safety monitoring system consists of voluntary reporting. If you or
 your doctor don’t tell the TGA or the drug company that you were injured then they don’t know and it’s not in
 the statistics. Because provisional registration means testing isn’t complete, this voluntary reporting makes
 up the safety profile of the drug. Doctors were discouraged in March 2021 when the medical boards and
AHPRAtold them not to criticise the genevaccines on social media or face disciplinary action. (18) The public
 had no idea how to report or even if they could. To monitor safety, the TGA tells drug companies to scan
 social media for reports of injuries.(19) But the Home Affairs Department and the federal Health Department
 both told social media platforms to censor posts by gene-vaccine injured people, as revealed by Freedom of
 Information requests.(20) This is insane. These products have now killed an unknown number of Australians.
 The TGA has received 1004 reports of deaths but claims only 14 are “linked to” the gene-vaccines (21) as of
 November 2. Experts estimate reports of injury and death are under-reported by up to 100 times and the
 death toll could be as high as 30,000 and rising. (22 )The products are still being promoted. Australia’s
 excess death rate soared by more than 10 percent since the products were distributed in 2021, which cannot
 be explained by covid, as has been exhaustively shown in the 470-page book Too Many Dead compiled by
 the Australian Medical Professionals Association.(23)

 The Health Department has refused for two years to release the definitive statistic: the all-cause mortality
figures stratified by vaccinal status and age, despite the gene-vaccines satisfying the Bradford Hill criteria for
causation.(24) These products would have been illegal in 2016 before the law was changed to allow
provisional registration. The Federal Government coerced the entire population to inject them while falsely
claiming the jabs weren’t compulsory. The Federal Government encouraged the states and corporations to
mandate it as a condition of employment, and refused to pass legislation to prevent vaccine discrimination
such as these two proposed Bills. (25) Nurses, doctors, bus drivers, journalists, police officers, supermarket
workers and almost everyone else were sacked if they didn’t inject. The injections are still listed as a
condition of employment in many jobs, based on the long-exposed lie that they “protect others from you” by
reducing transmission. The shots suppress the immune system and increase (26) (not decrease) your risk of
catching covid, as shown in UK data. (27) Permanent Canberra had decided, on zero evidence, that the jabs
were “safe and effective” before November 2020. 3

The government’s covid vaccination policy from November 2020 reveals the key messages already
prepared: “* A COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to protect the Australian community * Our goal is early
access to, and delivery, of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and treatments for all Australians * We
continue to follow our rigorous regulatory procedures in Australia to ensure that vaccine candidates are
effective and safe for use” (28) Canberra did not ask: what if the product is unsafe and kills people. How do
we stop? They had already bought the gene-vaccine sight unseen, trusting Pfizer despite prior convictions
for fraud.(29) The policy notes that it was “one of nine vaccines supported by the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership to accelerate vaccine development.” CEPI has long

^^^^^^^^^^^^Canberra trusts and defersto^^^^^^^^Harevered former public servant. (30)
CEPI wants to do away with the usual 10 to 15 years of safety testing to produce vaccines for injection in just
100 days, with mRNA as the platform to ram it through.(31) CEPI led the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s
push to promote the covid gene-vaccines, supporting the development of Moderna, Janssen, AstraZeneca
and Pfizer. (32)                  was appointed to conduct an “independent review” (33) of Australia’s covid
vaccine purchasing and procurement in 2022, in which she concluded Australia needed to pre-order more
gene-vaccines for 2024, and should reduce regulatory burden for drug companies even further.(34) This is a
conflict of interest. THIS WAS OVER A VIRUS LESS DEADLY THAN FLU FOR UNDER-60S Covid was
treated by the government as if it was airborne ebola in a terrible over-reaction that led to lockdowns and a
false belief that a rushed, unsafe gene-vaccine was needed to “save us”.. The infection fatality rate was only
ever up to 0.03% for people under 60, as shown by Stanford University professor^^^^^^^^^^H (35)
who calculated the rate across 29 countries during the ancestral strains, before the vaccine. The median age
of death in Australia from covid as of October 2022 was 85.5 years - higher than the normal life expectancy
at birth.(36) Australia would have done better by protected the elderly and promoting healthy eating and
exercise. US data showed 78% of adults hospitalised with covid were overweight or obese. (37) Instead the
government destroyed small businesses, careers, families and lives for two years, then mandated injections
of an experimental gene-vaccine that caused horrendous injuries and deaths including in young people not
at risk from covid.

WE MUST STOP NOWAND GET IT RIGHT

* Repeal the 2017 legislation creating Provisional Registration and insist on proper testing for novel drugs.
* Immediately halt the distribution of gene-vaccine products pending independent testing.
* Remove the influence of pharmaceutical corporations and their “philanthropic” partners such as the Bill &
  Melinda Gates Foundation or the Wellcome Trust from government and universities. Halt public-private
  partnerships.
* Sack, and where appropriate, prosecute the public servants and corporate lobbyists responsible for this
  disaster.
* Exit the World Health Organisation, which is no longer an advisory organisation representing member
  nations. It has become a public-private partnership paid for by corporations and billionaire “philanthropists”
  who direct policy. 4
