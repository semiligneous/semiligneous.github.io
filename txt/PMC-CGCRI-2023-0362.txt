COVID Vaccine Mandate Impact Statement

As a                                      I was severely impacted both mentally and
financially by the Vaccine Mandate imposed on educators which was introduced by the
Queensland Government for the start of the 2022 school year.

Due to a                    , in conjunction with uncertainty about underlying health
conditions                                 my GP requested that I be allowed to postpone my
vaccination until the Covax (non-MRNA) vaccine became available. As a result, my employer,
                                granted me permission to use a maximum 2 terms of long
service leave while I awaited Covax...this was the only option available to me. It was made
clear that if by the beginning of                     I had not been vaccinated, or if the
mandate had not been removed, that my employment,                               would be
terminated.

When Covax became available I received the vaccination as I had indicated I would. Shortly
after, the Queensland Government removed th                           so that they could
return to work from the start of            This is when I returned to work.

The whole situation where I was forced to step away from work for an extended period led
to a great deal of anxiety for my family as well as upsetting relationships I had with
colleagues and other community members. The cohesive manner in which I operate at work,
as a                                   interrupted and has still not returned to where it was
prior to 2022. The loss of these once strong relationships are now a cause of distress for me.

While I was not directly financially impacted at the time, I was forced to dip into my long
service leave at a time that my wife and I had not planned. This has unfortunately caused us
to alter our plans towards retirement.

Losing these 20 weeks of long service leave is a very bitter pill to swallow especially as I, with
the support of my GP, followed all of the rules imposed by my employer and the
government. I hope that there is some form of compensation in the pipeline whereby the
long service leave payments can be reimbursed to my employer thus reinstating the leave
that was taken from me.

Yours truly
