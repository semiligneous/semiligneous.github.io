Call for submissions and evidence to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry

As a recruitment industry professional I have experienced the profound and negative impacts of the
Australian Government's response to Covid. I see every day how our medical system is lacking staff
(Due to vaccine mandates), aged care is lacking staff (Due to vaccine mandates) and people across
the community are suffering profound adverse reactions to vaccines.

As a concerned citizen of Australia, I hereby call for a Royal Commission to be conducted
immediately, with a complete and proper investigation into:

    •          Corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts
    •          Mask mandates
    •          Lock downs
    •          Vaccine mandates
    •   Official misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block
        transmission, vaccine injuries
    •          Media censorship
    •          Silencing of doctors
    •   The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors, and the poor
        treatment of victims
    •   The role of non-elected global bureaucracies such as the WHO and UN in shaping Australia's
        response to Covid
    •          The effectiveness of Australia's response to Covid



The Australian Federal and State Government's responses to Covid have caused a great deal of harm
to virtually all Australians. The negative mental health impacts on the nation's children, the negative
impact on the economy, the lock down / closure of family run businesses (whilst large businesses
where allowed to operate), the increase in sovereign debt and the restrictions of freedoms of all
Australians.

The Australian Federal and State Government's responses to Covid need a thorough investigation so
as to understand the impacts of corruption, fraud and incompetence so as to ensure mechanisms
are put in place so as this can never be allowed to occur again.

The findings of the Royal Commission should be completely transparent so as Australia can learn
how to best protect Australians in the event of a health crisis.

Your sincerely,
