Submission to Australian Senate
Response to Covid 19

The response was extremely disorganised.
Australia should have adopted a National response... similar to the response to a ‘war’
situation.
Australia witnessed a completely disorganised and petty responses... even down to the
‘postcode’ areas .Premiers squabbling over resources and isolation restrictions. A
complete lack of mature balanced management.
A ‘war’ cabinet should be entrusted with full management of the nation.
