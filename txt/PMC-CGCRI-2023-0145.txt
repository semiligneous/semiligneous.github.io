As a family we made the decision early on not to get vaccinated with the experimental vaccine.
Our house hold consist of 8 people aged 10 12 15 17 45 58 73 74. Five at one stage tested
positive to covid. Symptoms were mild in all cases. Even in the 73 and 74 year old. Three
members may have had covid but were unsymptomatic. No one has had a second infection and
have been exposed to the disease on many occasions since. Compared to people we meet with
in our community we appear to have high immunity , most of these got vaccinated and have
multiple positives to covid and some have become very ill. Many also have developed immune
disorders and some have heart conditions they did not previously have. Local people in the
medical industry are talking ,off the record ,of unusually high cases of cardiovascular issues and
immune deficits. We are very pleased we made the decision not to get the vaccine and were
lucky not to have to for our work place. Many people we know felt forced to be vaccinated for
work and financial reasons because of mandates and regret having done so. As many have paid
with their health and well being. This matter is of the most extreme significants to the way we are
governed and how fear was used along with mandates to control our decisions. A Royal
Commision is required to make good on this low point in our governance and some key decision
makers will need to be held to account. Yours Sincerely William Bennett
