Covid Inquiry Committee
Submission on the COVID-19 Response

Dear Committee,

I am writing to provide a perspective on the Australian government's COVID-19 response, framed
within the principles of the Great Barrington Declaration. This submission emphasizes the critical need
for government transparency, informed consent, ethical considerations, and adherence to
constitutional principles.

Transparency and Accountability:

Transparency is paramount for fostering public trust. The inquiry must ensure authenticity, avoiding
any semblance of obfuscation in the examination of the government's pandemic response.
Acknowledging and addressing any shortcomings openly is essential for maintaining public
confidence.

Informed Consent and Ethical Principles:

Respecting individual autonomy, as per the principles of informed consent and the Nuremberg Code,
is crucial. Individuals must be fully informed about the risks and benefits of public health interventions,
particularly vaccination. Upholding the Nuremberg Code principles ensures freedom in personal
health decisions without facing discrimination or coercion.

Recommendations for Government:

Transparent Communication: The government should provide unequivocal and transparent
communication about decision-making processes, data, and scientific evidence. Recent instances of
information concealment in other countries                                 recently charged with
murder for concealing vaccine safety information) underscore the importance of transparency,
reinforcing public trust.

Informed Consent in Vaccination: Uphold principles of informed consent during COVID-19
vaccination. Ensure individuals receive comprehensive information, enabling autonomous decisions.
Vaccination must remain voluntary, with no imposition of mandates or employment repercussions
based on vaccination status.

Constitutional Adherence: Investigate the seemingly bypassed Australian Constitution during the
implementation of a de-facto compulsory vaccination regime. Section 51 (xxiiiA) explicitly prohibits
civil conscription, necessitating a thorough examination of the circumstances leading to this deviation.

Economic Impact:

Prolonged lockdowns have resulted in far-reaching economic consequences, including inflation, small
business closures, and wealth transfer to large corporations. A detailed inquiry should evaluate the
impacts and effectiveness of government measures.

Recommendations for Economic Examination:

Inflationary Pressures: Investigate the impact of lockdowns on inflation rates. Assess mitigation
measures and support for those disproportionately affected.

Small Business Closures: Scrutinize reasons for closures and explore avenues for relief and recovery
support. Evaluate the effectiveness of existing assistance programs.



                                                     1
Wealth Transfer: Examine policies contributing to wealth transfer. Evaluate economic relief measures
for fairness and equity. Did any politicians benefit?

Contract Transparency with Big Pharma: Examine contracts with pharmaceutical companies to
ensure transparency, fair pricing, and equitable access to vaccines and treatments.

Recommendations for Contract Transparency:

Transparency: Evaluate the transparency of contracts, ensuring disclosure of terms and conditions to
the public.

Fair Pricing: Assess pricing agreements to prevent exploitation of public funds and maintain public
trust.

Localized Decision-Making:

Assess the government's lockstep approach and consider the efficacy of a more localized decision­
making model, akin to the Swedish model.

Recommendations for Localized Decision-Making:

Feasibility and Efficacy: Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of localized decision-making, considering
diverse regional circumstances.

Comparison with Swedish Model: Examine outcomes of the lockstep approach versus the Swedish
model, emphasizing localized decision-making and minimal intervention. Emphasis should be placed
on the continuing excess death crisis.

Encouraging Dissenting Voices:

Promote diverse scientific perspectives and open debate for more informed, balanced decision­
making.

Recommendations for Scientific Diversity:

Promotion of Dissent: Emphasize the importance of dissenting voices in the scientific community for
a more comprehensive understanding of the virus and the facilitation of a better response.

Open Debate: Foster an environment that encourages open debate and discussion to challenge
assumptions and enhance decision-making.

Unethical Use of Fear and Psyops Methods:

Scrutinize potential fear-based communication and psychological operations, ensuring ethical
communication practices and mental health support.

Recommendations for Ethical Communication:

Examine Communication Strategies: Scrutinize government communication strategies, ensuring they
prioritize transparency and avoid inducing fear and anxiety.

Mental Health Support: Implement measures to support public mental health, recognizing the
potential psychological impact of fear-based messaging.

In closing, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the committee's commitment to
conducting this vital inquiry into the Australian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The issues raised in this submission are of paramount importance, encompassing transparency, ethical

diversity, and the potential use of fear-based communication and psychological operations.

As a concerned citizen deeply invested in the well-being of our nation, however, I respectfully submit
that, given the gravity and complexity of the matters at hand, a Royal Commission may be the most
effective means to thoroughly investigate and address the multifaceted aspects of the government's
response. A Royal Commission is renowned for its independence and impartiality, qualities that are
pivotal in ensuring a comprehensive and unbiased examination. The gravity of the situation demands
an investigation that transcends political considerations, protection of the political and bureaucratic
classes and focuses solely on the well-being and interests of the Australian public.

I believe that a Royal Commission would not only provide a more robust and impartial assessment but
also instil greater public confidence in the process. The transparency, accountability, and
independence inherent in a Royal Commission are crucial elements that align with the principles of
fairness and justice we hold dear.

 trust that the committee will consider this recommendation with due diligence, understanding that
my intent is to contribute to a process that prioritizes the truth, accountability, and the best interests
of our nation.

Thank you once again for your commitment to this important inquiry.



Sincerely,



15/12/2023
