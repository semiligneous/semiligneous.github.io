3.   Research Aims and Questions:

The COVID-19 impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities highlighted a gap in
understanding the challenges, successes, and future improvements across the crisis continuum, from
planning through to recovery. To address these gaps, this research aimed to explore and learn from
Aboriginal communities keeping safe and coping with respect to COVID-19. We conducted yarning
workshops with Aboriginal community members, health workers and Elders, in one metro and one
regional area in Western Australia. We provide a summary of participant perceptions in this
submission.
                                                                                                         2


Key research questions were as follows:

1. How did Aboriginal community members (especially Elders) keep safe and cope with respect to
COVID-19? (see Table 2).

2. What were the enablers in Aboriginal communities keeping safe and well during COVID-19? (see
Figure 2)

3. What factors undermined Aboriginal communities' ability to keep safe and well during COVID-19?
(see Figure 2)

4. What policy implications are there for future emergencies? (see Figure 3)



    In summary, this research collected stories that provided insights on the impact of COVID-19 and
    how crisis policies into the future can be improved. There was a focus on creating a set of
    principles learned from capturing the perspectives, wisdom, and unique needs of Aboriginal
    Elders. Learnings are for stakeholders supporting and working two-way with Aboriginal
    communities and Elders if resurgent and future crises emerge. Community ownership and self­
    determined solutions based on Indigenous principles are needed to find equilibrium in keeping
    Elders safe from illness and crisis, while upholding Indigenous rights and cultural needs
    (Dudgeon et al., 2023).


4. Research Design:
    This study followed Aboriginal Participatory Action Research methodologies (ARAR) (Dudgeon et
    al., 2020c) to privilege local Aboriginal voices across Western Australia and relay their
    experiences during the pandemic. Indigenous research methodologies are also entrenched in
    individual and collective emancipation and provide a safe place for healing and being heard.
    ARAR was chosen as the most appropriate methodology as it fosters collaborative and equitable
    partnerships instilled with trust and respect, while challenging longstanding notions of inequity
    and marginalization. We also oriented this project towards practical action, identifying collective
    risk and protective factors, or enablers and barriers, on what makes a crisis response ethical,
    fair, and most safe. This research intends to offer practical suggestions which paint a picture of
    participants' stories in the form of recommended principles to consider during a future crisis.


    Data Collection
    A total of 52 participants between the ages of 18 and 85 (75% female) from different
    communities in WA participated in a total of 10 workshops. See Table 1 below for more details
    on participant and workshop characteristics. Additionally, Figure 1 shows a map of workshop
    location sites. The location of the workshops was chosen by partnering organisations and the
    participants, where they felt most comfortable and familiar in their own communities.
    Purposive sampling was conducted with existing networks of the research team, as well as by
    approaching Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS), Aboriginal Community
    Controlled Organisations (ACCO), and Aboriginal corporations with the intent of the research to
    obtain appropriate interest, endorsement, and assist with recruitment. ACCHS and ACCOs were
    strongly involved in the COVID-19 pandemic response and provided continuity of care for
    Aboriginal people during times of uncertainty. The design purposefully sampled Elders,

    community members, and workers to fulfil the experiences required for the research aims and
    questions.

   Data Analysis
   Thematic analysis (TA) was the preferred qualitative data analysis method to allow the research
   team to work collaboratively and ethically, and transparently interpret and organise the data. TA
   inspired by Indigenous Standpoint Theory (1ST) and Complex Adaptive Systems Theory (CAS)
   gave the analytical process greater rigor to allow the team to reflect deeply about the insights
   and experiences captured with the purposes of affecting positive change in public health policy
   and emergency management. Through the paradigm of 1ST, participants' stories were kept
   intact, while the CAS theory allowed us to comprehend the different actors, processes and
   changes that strongly characterised rapid evolution during the pandemic response.


5. Results
   1 .    How did Aboriginal community members (especially Elders) keep safe and cope with
         respect to COVID-19?

   - The first research question presented some challenges in defining Elders, perhaps attesting to
   the diversity of meaning across communities. Participants often used the term Elders and older
   people interchangeably, making it difficult to attribute stories from the perspectives of or about
   Elders or older people, or both. We therefore use the term Elders to be inclusive of older people
   as well, without an 'Elder' status necessarily.

   -      A summary of themes relevant to question 1 are presented below in Table 2.
                                                                                                         6

7.   Conclusion

This research gathered learnings about experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic from Aboriginal Elders, community
members, and organisations. Participants gave their stories humbly, with the wish to see Australian society grow and
mature in crisis management and public health efforts. Participants commended and appreciated the actions of the
COVID-19 pandemic response with attention on keeping people safe but implore greater flexibility so that culture
and Aboriginal rights remain of equal importance. It is imperative to understand, and not assume, how different
communities want to work with organisations and people during crises. Structures and processes with both
organisations and communities need to be empowered early to guide ethical emergency action when it arises, based
on the diversity of omnipresent community voices and preferences.
