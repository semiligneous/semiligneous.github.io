To whom it may concern,

I am writing today for an appeal to a royal commission enquiry on the many failed aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
As well ^aeing personally affected by the closure of a government facility which was a 'mother and baby unit' when my
baby wa^jweeks old. I was denied access to th^acilit^ifteni^^Jveek stay and told to either go home or travel a
further^Hhours to another facility. This was
I'm also writing for the enquiry to the corrupt vaccine procurement and secret contracts; the mask mandates which are
still ongoing ton Victorian hospitals and places of health care;Victorian lock downs; vaccine mandates, official
misinformation and lies in the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block transmission, vaccine injuries which I
personally know many many people who suffered from this and it is well evidenced to have been quite a lot; media
censorship, silencing of doctors who I personally knew matched in the Victorian marches, the role of AHPRA and ATAGI in
censorship and oppression of doctors, and the poor treatment of victims.

You need to hold those accountable for what was done to the general population and I'll have you know God knows all so
hiding won't get you very far. Come clean, fess us and do the right things.

Kind regards.
