             Commonwealth Government Covid-19 Response Inquiry
            Submission made by The World Of Wellness International Limited - The WOW.

The WOW The World of Wellness is an international health advocacy and educational think tank, dedicated
to equipping our fellow humans with access to best principles and practices for their wellbeing.
The WOW is dedicated to the retention and improvement of human rights and free will for everyone across
the globe, including the right to full and informed consent and the individual’s autonomy over medical
procedures free of coercion. The WOW wants it to be noted from the outset of this inquiry should
instead fall under the auspices of a Royal Commission.

A Call for Reform and Accountability: This human tragedy demands a collective response.
The response by Australian governments to the Covid-19 pandemic has been avoidably complex and
controversial. Very few aspects were successful, and most raised serious ethical, scientific, medical, and
human rights concerns. To move forward, a comprehensive review and reform of the healthcare system is
imperative. Open dialogue, transparency, and a commitment to ethical practices must be prioritised to restore
trust in the medical system and ensure the well-being of both patients and healthcare workers.
We must acknowledge the pain and suffering inflicted, leam from past mistakes, and work together to create
a ‘public’ healthcare system that prioritises ethical practices, respects individual autonomy, and upholds the
highest standards of care and compassion. Only then can we begin to heal the wounds of the pandemic and
build a future where the human cost of such crises is minimised, and the voices of healthcare professionals
and public are valued and heard.

A Dark Shadow Over Healthcare: The Extreme Human Tragedy of Covid-19 Mismanagement
The Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly been a time of great upheaval and uncertainty, impacting every
facet of life. However, the shadows cast upon the healthcare system have been particularly grim, revealing a
disturbing trend of mismanagement that has resulted in extreme human tragedy for countless individuals,
including doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers.
Silenced Voices and Broken Trust
One of the most egregious aspects of this tragedy has been the silencing of voices within the medical
community. Doctors and nurses who dared to question the official narrative, express concerns about potential
adverse effects from new Covid-19 interventions, or advocate for alternative treatment options were met with
hostility, silencing, and even termination of employment. This suppression of differing medical opinion not
only impeded the pursuit of truth and scientific understanding but also destroyed trust in the very institutions
responsible for public health, better now termed government health.
The Erosion of Basic Human Rights
The pandemic also witnessed disregard for human rights, especially within hospital settings. Patients were
isolated from loved ones in their final moments, families were denied the opportunity to say goodbye, and
informed consent for procedures was ignored. These inhumane practices caused immense emotional distress,
trauma, and resulted in untold numbers of preventable death.
Denial and Lies
Hospital administrations engaged in a dangerous denial and misinformation. Concerns about serious adverse
events from the Covid interventions, particularly the rise of cardiomyopathy in young individuals, were
dismissed or downplayed, where willful blindness has now become an atrocious standard of medical
practice. This lack of willingness to not acknowledge potential harms has eroded public trust in the
healthcare system, where now the key terms of ‘health’ and ‘care’appear to have been made redundant to a
new ‘government controlled system’, bom from Covid.
Fake Vaccines and Passports
The emergence of fake vaccines and vaccine passports compounded the ethical dilemma characteristic of the
pandemic response, involving as they did a blatant disregard for public health and safety that not only
endangered individuals but undermined the entire vaccination campaign, fostering mistrust and skepticism.
Unnecessary Bullying and Sackings
Many healthcare workers experienced unwarranted bullying and unjustified terminations. Dedicated
professionals who served with compassion and dedication were cast aside simply for questioning
government Covid messaging, creating a climate of fear and intimidation that destroyed open dialogue with
and within the medical community.
Gagging and Lack of Informed Consent
2
The gagging of medical professionals and the failure to provide patients with complete and accurate
information about identified risks observed early with the government sponsored Covid interventions,
ensured the pandemic became a crisis. This lack of transparency and informed consent robbed individuals of
their agency and autonomy, contributing to a sense of powerlessness and now enduring mistrust.
Autopsies Ignored and Causes of Death Misrepresented
The failure to perform autopsies for deaths after receiving the government’s Covid drugs, coupled with the
misrepresentation of causes of death, casts a dark shadow over the entire pandemic response. The lack of
investigation and transparency raises serious questions about the extent of harm caused by the Covid-19
drugs, especially the genetic vaccines, and likely knowledge within Australian governments of these
preventable outcomes.
The Toll on Mental Health
The response by Australian governments took a significant toll on the mental health of healthcare workers.
Witnessing immense suffering, navigating ethical dilemmas, and facing constant fear and uncertainty
resulted in widespread burnout, anxiety, and depression. This mental health crisis within the medical
workforce requires immediate attention and support. It is going to last for many years to come.
A Divided Community and Restrictions at Funerals
The pandemic response further divided communities, creating animosity and suspicion between individuals
with differing viewpoints. Restrictions imposed on funerals and grieving processes added another layer of
emotional distress and prevented closure for many families.
Loss of Confidence and Trust
The cumulative effect of these failures by Australian governments has resulted in a significant loss of
confidence and trust in the medical and hospital system. Individuals are left feeling disillusioned, questioning
the integrity of scientific institutions and the competence of healthcare professionals.

Further Critical Examination of Australia's COVID-19 Response
The response by Australian governments to the Covid-19 pandemic has been marked by few successes and
major failures. Key points of failure requiring further independent examination include:
  •     Failure to Recognise a Lab Origin: The government's initial stance on the lab-origin hypothesis of
        the virus remains unclear, and a thorough investigation into this matter is crucial.
  •     Lockdowns and their Effectiveness: The implementation of strict lockdowns across the country
        raises questions about their effectiveness and the economic and social costs associated with them.
  •     Uncertainties Regarding Vaccine Efficacy and Safety: The promotion of the Covid-19 injections
        as "safe and effective" despite lack of evidence and ongoing safety concerns requires transparent and
        open discourse.
  •     TGA's Role in Safety and Efficacy Assessment: The TGA's failure to independently evaluate the
        Covid-19 injections raises questions about its independence and ability to protect the public from
        unsafe drugs. Relying on the FDA and drug sponsors for this information has seen the TGA abdicate
        its legal duties.
Mandates and Misinformation
  •     Unsubstantiated Claims about Transmission: Australian government claims that Covid-19
        vaccines stopped transmission contradicted the scientific evidence and clinical trial data from
        sponsors.
  •     False Narrative of Pandemic of the Unvaccinated: The "pandemic of the unvaccinated" narrative
        demonised a specific group and lacked scientific basis yet was promoted by Australian governments.
  •     Fear-mongering and Public Manipulation: The government's communication strategy relied
        heavily on fear-mongering, grossly hindering informed decision-making, and was despicable.
Treatment Options and Scientific Concerns
  •     Denial of Early Treatment: The suppression of early treatment options like hydroxychloroquine
        and ivermectin resulted in preventable deaths.
  •     Exaggerated Death Predictions: The grossly exaggerated death predictions by institutions like the
        Doherty Institute contributed to unnecessary fear and anxiety.
  •     Ignoring Adverse Events and Deaths: The continued dismissal of adverse events and deaths
        associated with the Covid-19 injections undermines transparency and accountability.
  •     Courts Failing to Consider Scientific Evidence: Judicial decisions regarding Covid-19 laws and
        policies disregarded valid scientific evidence, placing in doubt the impartiality of the legal system.
Censorship and Suppression
3
    •  Media Censorship of Dissenting Voices: The silencing of scientists and doctors who questioned the
       government narrative hindered open debate and scientific progress.
  •    Silencing Healthcare Professionals: The APHRA's suspension of healthcare professionals who
       disagreed with the government's Covid policies created a chilling effect on freedom of expression.
  •    Lack of Informed Consent for Injections: Patients were not adequately informed about the risks
       associated with the Covid-19 injections, placing in doubt valid Informed Consent.
Unjustified Policies and Unanswered Questions
  •    Use of mRNA Injections for Children and Pregnant Women: The authorisation of mRNA
       injections for these vulnerable groups raises serious ethical concerns due to the lack of long-term
       safety data, or indeed any data.
  •    PCR Testing and Case Inflation: The reliance on the PCR test for case identification resulted in
       inaccurate case numbers and inflated death tolls.
  •    Ignoring Natural Immunity: The government's failure to recognise natural immunity created
       confusion and distrust amongst the public.
  •       Secrecy and Lack of Transparency: The government's opaque decision-making process and lack of
       hansparency regarding contracts with vaccine manufacturers raise concerns about accountability.
Further Issues and Concerns
  •    Excessive Force against Peaceful Protests: The use of excessive force against peaceful Covid-19
       protestors by Australian governments financed by the Commonwealth government in their Covid-19
       responses, represents a departure from democratic governance and the rale of law.
  •    Unexplained Excess Deaths: The significant rise in unexplained deaths following the Covid-19
       vaccine rollout demands urgent investigation.
  •    Lack of Risk-Benefit Analysis: The government's failure to conduct a proper risk-benefit analysis
       of lockdowns, mandates, and vaccines raises questions about their justification.
  •    Ongoing Safety Concerns and Unreported Data: The TGA's lack of hansparency regarding
       ongoing adverse events and the absence of proper post-marketing surveillance raise concerns about
       vaccine safety.
  •    Misrepresenting Hospitalisation Data: The lack of transparency regarding the vaccination status of
       hospitalised Covid-19 patients hinders public understanding of the vaccine's effectiveness.
  •    Vaccine Injuries and Lack of Compensation: The inadequate compensation scheme for Covid-19
       vaccine injuries and the government's protection of the manufacturers raise concerns about
       accountability and justice.

Recommendations
1. Allocate significant funding for research and development of early treatment options, including known
and proven effective repurposed drags such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, the lifesaving
nutraceuticals vitamins D and C and zinc, and other readily available interventions. The National Institute of
Integrative Medicine (NUM) has the comprehensive knowledge and experience to perform this research.
2. Streamline regulatory processes to facilitate the timely adoption of effective early and natural treatments.
This entails a separate regulatory system to the TGA which is dominated by the conflicted interests of Big
Pharma.
3. Provide clear and consistent communication to healthcare providers and the public about the availability
and benefits of early treatment options. Education programs such as those of the ACNEM are a priority.
4. Develop a comprehensive plan for future pandemics, including stockpiling effective early treatment
options.
5. Establish a truly independent body to oversee the government's response to future pandemics and ensure
hansparency and accountability.
