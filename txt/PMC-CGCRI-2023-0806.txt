Individual Royal Commission submission - COVID

Name:            Residence      Australian born citizen


Background
The government and its appointees have acted in bad faith, been caught is lies and
deceptive behaviour. Claims made throughout pandemic have been exposed as
fraud. The terms of reference should be constructed in a manner that will allow
vigilant community groups access to all materials and prepare submissions to refute
the raft of cover ups planed as submissions for this Royal Commission.

The terms of reference below are specifically designed to allow “Selected”
representatives from “Selected” diversity groups to be the only significant
submission. My submission specifically addresses this attempted cover up.

Real people had a wrecking ball through their lives this Royal Commission and the
terms of reference should scope and be structured to allow the systematically
censored and persecuted individuals and groups to have a clear voice and rebuttal
of doctored evidence by government and their beneficial private partners. Babies
died, old people died, young people died and a great many people harmed as a
consequence of informed actions. International groups have analysed both super
national and national participants this evidence forms the basis of grievance

Each of the scoping areas to receive community submission on harm. Such
submissions to be collated and presented as a matrix of misery. The scope of each
part to include the coercive measured used by government and their private partners

Independent Panel
The Prime Minister has appointed an Independent Panel of three eminent people to
conduct the Inquiry.

The panel should only include people from outside any previous government
involvement. Diversity should be exactly as per the Australian demographics.

Taskforce
A Taskforce within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will support the
Independent Panel.

The taskforce should only be from outside government. Such community taskforce
has precedent in Canada with the NATIONAL CITIZEN’S INQUIRY of Canada. It
delivered an unbiased and excellent set of findings.

Public consultation
       Members of the public. Any and all should have the same and equal standing
       and opportunity. Given the same time and exactly the same consideration.
       Anything else would be a whitewash.
