RE: COVID-19 Response Inquiry

Dear Panel members,

 am writing these submissions as a concerned Australian citizen. I have a Bachelor of Laws
and grew up in a medical / engineering family with an appreciation of the scientific method
and logical reasoning. I am concerned because there was no scientific basic to justify the
government’s response to COVID-19 - the vaccines, the lockdowns, the masks, the social
distancing, the vaccine passports, OR codes, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine. I will
keep this submission short but please appreciate that there is a mountain of evidence to
prove Australia’s COVID-19 response was flawed to the core. The following points should be
considered:

1. Without the use of trypsin there is no evidence that the alleged Sars-CoV-2 virus exists.
   The paper “Isolation and rapid sharing of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from
   the first patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in Australia” is the first paper that describes
   the alleged isolation and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia.
                                              t states!                             .   ..




                                                                This statement admits that no
   spike protein was found within the cell culture until they added trypsin (a pancreatic
   enzyme which digests proteins). The addition of trypsin created the spikes in the protein.
   This methodology and reasoning is inherently deceptive and misleading. It cannot
   scientifically establish the existence of a virus.
2. Without the use of Artificial Intelligence (Al) there is also no evidence of the SARS-CoV-2
   virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been defined to be a genome sequence, packaged up
   in a spike protein. A genome is approximately 30,000 base pairs long. In the same paper

                                                                                                 1
   cited above, it states


   |||||||||||||M                                          7 ne similarity of the genome

   sequences between the already published sample from Wuhan and their isolate does not
   prove anything when the process is flawed. This is because a) the cell culture would
   have contained millions of base pairs; b) the study assumed SARS-CoV-2 virus to be in
   the cell culture; c) they used Al to match the sample with the contents of the cell culture,
   using the sample as a template. In other words, Al built the SARS-CoV-2 genome
   sequence provided by Wuhan, from the base pairs in the cell culture. If another genome
   sequence was provided, Al would have built that sequence from the same cell culture.
   This process would guarantee a 99.99% sequence identity with the sample because it is
   a creation of Al. It doesn’t prove the cell culture contained any SARS-CoV-2 virus, only
   that the cell culture contained 99.99% of the base pairs of the sample genome sequence
   provided by Wuhan. For a more detailed analysis of the COVID-19 flawed process,
   please refer to https://drsambailev.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/A-FAREWELL-TQ-

3. There are no studies proving contagion. At no time has it been shown that an alleged
   pathogen, when exposed to a healthy person, causes disease (^^■ □stulates have

   never been satisfied for viruses. Without proof of contagion, masks, social distancing,
   lockdowns and isolation were pointless.
4. The PCR test is not fit for the purpose of diagnosing disease according to inventor!
          The Lisbon Appeal Court confirmed this, concluding:




          In the eyes of this court, then, a positive test does not correspond to a COVID-19
   case. The two most important reasons for this, said the judges, are that, “the test’s
   reliability depends on the number of cycles used” and that “the test’s reliability depends
   on the viral load present.” https://www.theportuqalnews.com/news/202Q-11 -27/covid-pcr-
   test-reliability-doubtful-portuqal-judqes/56962 We should remember that asymptomatic
   individuals were encouraged to get tested and received false positives
   https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS221 3-2600(2C)30453-7/fulltext
   COVID- 9 COVID-19 cases were artificially inflated due to the inaccuracy and
   unreliability of the PCR testing. Creating a pandemic out of nothing.
5. COVID-19 seems to be a rebranding of the flu, pneumonia and respiratory infection. On
   the Australian Bureau of Statistics website, the deaths in 2019 from influenza and
   pneumonia amounted to 4,124. https://www.abs.qov.au/statistics/health/causes-
               -        stralia/2019 In 2020, “deaths due to respiratory disease were

                                                                                                  2
   16.2% lower than historical averages. Decreases were recorded in both chronic and
   acute respiratory diseases. Influenza and pneumonia deaths were 36.0% lower than the
   historical average.” https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/provisional-
   mortalitv-statistics/jan-dec-2020 In 2020, 55 people died from the flu and 898 people
   died from COVID-19. The median age at death was 86 years. COVID-19, like the flu,
   mostly killed the elderly or those with comorbidities
   https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/causes-death-australia/latest-
    e ease If the deaths attributed to COVID-19 were recorded together with the flu,
   pneumonia and respiratory infection, there would still be a significant decrease in deaths
   from the previous years.
6. The COVID-19 vaccines are an experimental injection with no long-term data available to
   determine whether it was safe and effective. It is now widely admitted that the vaccines
   do not stop infection or transmission. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21 )00648-4
   There is also a plethora of evidence to show that these vaccines are not safe, causing
   serious adverse events and death. Some notable observations include:
       a) The article published in Circulation, titled “Abstract 10712: Mrna COVID Vaccines
            Dramatically Increase Endothelial Inflammatory Markers and ACS Risk as
            Measured by the PULS Cardiac Test: a Warning”, concludes with |




            https://www.ahajournals.Org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.144.suppl 1.10712 Hence the
            vast number of athletes that have died since taking the COVID-19 vaccine.
       b) The COVID-19 vaccines are causing permanent disability and pharmaceutical
            dependency for Australians. As well as heart attacks, pericarditis, myocarditis,
            there are blood clots, sometimes needing amputation, antibody- dependant
            enhancement https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5
       c) Since the COVID-19 vaccine roll out there has been an increase in cancers, now
            commonly referred to as “turbo cancer”.

            among-youngerpeople-around-the-world/
       d) The TGA’s has received more Adverse Event reports in 2021 through June 2022
            for the COVID-19 vaccines, than they have been seen for all other vaccines in
            the preceding 50-year period.
       e)          The COVID-19 vaccines reactivate shingles.
            https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35470920/

                                                                                               3
       f)   Indeed, the vaccines are killing more people than they purportedly saved.
            https://www.y utube.com/watoh?v=WFph7-6t34M&t= 15606s
       g) It is also generally acknowledged that adverse events are under-reported around
            the world, with estimates that 90-95% of adverse events not reported to
            regulators. https://www.tqa.qcv.au/media-reiease/new-web-service-helps-
            consumer-reportinq-side-effects
       h) Any analysis of excess deaths reveals the huge spike in deaths immediately
            following the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Highly vaccinated countries are suffering
            more than others.

In addition, the devastating extent of COVID-19 vaccine injuries and deaths are not being
adequately addressed by the government. The Australian people are not being properly
informed. Instead, there is a campaign against misinformation. Questioning voices are
labelled and immediately dismissed as “anti-vaxxers” and “conspiracy theorists”. This is
unfortunate as we can no longer trust our doctors and journalists to give their expert opinion
any more. It has been reported that AHPRA was silencing health professionals with threats
of deregistration if anything was said against the national COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

                                                                                                 4
Silencing dissenting voices is antithetical to science and it should not be happening in a
pluralistic country like Australia. The precautionary principle of medicine was set aside for
this experimental vaccine with no long-term data to establish safety or efficacy. Australian
public officials should not be repeating disinformation given to them by foreign vaccine
manufacturing corporations or foreign powers such as the WHO, China or Israel. They
should be making their own independent inquires to confirm the veracity of information using
critical analysis of what is presented to them.

It is clear that the SARS-CoV-2 virus model was created in a computer, utilising Al
technology. This is not science. The response to the fabricated pandemic was not based on
science either. The PCR tests and masks were useless. The lockdowns and social
distancing were destructive to the community. The OR codes and vaccine passports were
draconian. The COVID-19 vaccines (which have yet to be recalled) are neither safe or
effective. I believe there needs to be a full and open parliamentary inquiry into the COVID-19
response as the people need to see our public officers held to account.

Yours sincerely,




Susan Craig
