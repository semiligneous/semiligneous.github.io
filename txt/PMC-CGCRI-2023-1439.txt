Dear COVID-19 Response Inquiry,

In this submission, I aim to underscore the need for Australia to direct its attention towards
proactively preventing future pandemics, rather than merely preparing for them. It appears
that Australia's governments heavily invest in hazard reduction for other natural disasters
and have intensified their efforts due to climate change. Surprisingly, I'm not aware of a
similar commitment to reducing the likelihood of pandemics, despite the seemingly higher
risk to the average Australian.

As a young Australian, the impact of COVID-19 was particularly challenging for my
demographic. The repercussions of COVID-19 have affected various aspects of my life, from
education, health, and my relationships, revealing the inadequacy of our communities in
handling such adversities. These experiences have greatly shaped my perspective on how
government can support individuals and communities. Even in the best-managed pandemic
scenarios, there are profound consequences. Hence, I emphasise the importance of
prioritising pandemic prevention strategies to enhance Australia's readiness for potential
future outbreaks.

Reducing the Risk of Zoonoses

Research has shown that the likelihood of zoonotic pandemics is more significant than
commonly perceived and is on the rise. Drivers such as land use change, climate change,
and travel and trade are well-established factors contributing to the emergence of novel
pathogens. While recognising that halting these activities entirely may not be feasible, the
Inquiry should propose practical interventions aimed at reducing domestic risks and
advocate for international approaches to encourage others to adopt similar measures.

Land use change, as exemplified by urbanisation causing both nutritional stress and the
fragmentation of flying fox habitats, has been identified as a key driver of disease spill over
from animals to humans. An instance is the Hendra virus spill over into horses and humans
in Queensland. Practical interventions recommended by the Inquiry could address such
issues, both domestically and internationally.

The side effects of travel and trade extend to the spread of disease, with concerns regarding
legal (live animal exports) and illegal (smuggling) trade contributing to spill over risks.
Notably, coronaviruses traced to pangolins seized from illegal wildlife trade in Vietnam were
found to originate in China. The provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi, where bats carry SARS-
related coronaviruses most similar to SARS-CoV-2, are critical points of concern. The Inquiry
could recommend interventions and programs to mitigate these risks.

While recognising the Inquiry's terms of reference do not explicitly cover assisting foreign
governments, recommendations for international policies supporting Australians at home fall
within its scope. Leveraging Australian international leadership for global pandemic
prevention is crucial, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The Inquiry can suggest
recommendations for regional capacity building, building on the work of organisations like
the Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security, and expanding efforts focused on pandemic
prevention.

Australia's track record of international leadership in biosafety and biosecurity regulation, as
a member of the International Experts Group and through advocacy for chemical and
biological weapons security, can be further strengthened. Recommendations include
regularly reporting zoonotic disease cases to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)
and encouraging the inclusion of zoonoses prevention standards in free trade agreements
related to animals and animal products.
The early detection of novel pathogens

Efforts to prevent future pandemics must be a dual approach, encompassing the prevention
of pathogen emergence and the establishment of plans and technologies for swift response
in case of an outbreak.

Examining the timeline from the first human SARS-COV-2 infection on 17 November, it
becomes evident that the delay in response had significant consequences. There were 44
days between the first infection and the initial response on 31 December 2019, 54 days to
genome publication on 10 January 2020, and 67 days to the lockdown of Wuhan on 23
January 2020. This timeframe allowed the virus to spread globally. Modelling indicates that
earlier lockdown measures in Wuhan could have drastically reduced COVID-19 cases by
66%, 86%, or 95%, depending on one, two, or three weeks earlier lockdowns.

Despite this setback, success stories exist, demonstrating the possibility of preventing an
outbreak from escalating into a pandemic. Both Taiwan and New Zealand achieved 100
consecutive days free of community transmission during the first year of COVID-19, thanks
to a proactive understanding of the severity of SARS-CoV-2 when case numbers were low.
The containment of previous outbreaks like the 2002-2004 BARS and Ebola further
emphasizes that containment is achievable.

Reflecting on the unfortunate situation in Wuhan, it is clear that the capability to detect a
novel pathogen outbreak, disseminate information, and respond promptly could have altered
the course of events, potentially preventing a pandemic and saving lives and resources.

While acknowledging Australia's inability to criticize China, it is crucial to recognize our own
shortcomings. Currently lacking early detection capacity and plans for containing novel
pathogens at jurisdictional or national levels, Australia is ill-equipped to identify and act
promptly in the face of an emerging pathogen.

There exists an opportunity to rectify this situation and proactively prepare for the next
pandemic. The Inquiry should recommend that the CDC draft a white paper proposing
options for a national system geared towards the early detection of pathogens. This should
include an exploration of costs and benefits and a presentation to the government before the
close of 2024. The white paper should delve into a combination of proven techniques and
emerging technologies, such as metagenomics, with the ultimate goal of establishing a
robust and enduring system safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of Australians from future
pandemics.

In conclusion, I believe pandemics are a critical issue, and the rising potential future risks of
outbreaks demands careful consideration. This inquiry should focus on specific
recommendations to reduce the likelihood of future pandemics, covering timeless risks like
zoonoses and looking into the early detection of novel pathogens with pandemic potential.
Such approaches ensure a comprehensive strategy to address the evolving landscape of
infectious diseases.
