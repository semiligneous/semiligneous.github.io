Protocol: Real-time RT-PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2

Institut Pasteur, Paris


This protocol describes procedures for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 for two RdRp targets (IP2 and IP4).

Based on the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2 made available on the GISAID database on January 11,
20207 primers and probes (nCoV_IP2 and nCoV_IP4) were designed to target the RdRp gene spanning
nt 12621-12727 and 14010-14116 (positions according SARS-CoV, NC_004718).

As a confirmatory assay, we used the E gene assay from the Charite protocol1

 NUCLEIC ACID EXTRACTION

 RNA is extracted from specimens using the NucleoSpin Dx Virus (Macherey Nagel ref. 740895.50).
 RNA extracted from 100 pl of original sample, is eluted in 100 pl of elution buffer.

                                                                                                                  1

CONTROLS
Each real-time RT-PCR assay includes in addition of unknown samples:
    •   Two negative samples bracketing unknown samples during RNA extraction (negative
        extraction controls)
    •   Positive controls (in duplicate); when using in vitro synthesized transcripts as controls
        include five quantification positive controls (in duplicate) including 105, 104 and 103
        copies genome equivalent (ge) of in vitro synthesized RNA transcripts.
    •         One negative amplification control.

  SENSITIVITY
   For the nCoVJP and E_Sarbeco real-time RT-PCR
   Sensitivity, in terms of 95% hit rate is about 100 copies of RNA genome equivalent per reaction
   (this amount of target sequences is always detected), the probability to detect lower amounts of
   virus decreases, but samples containing 10 copies could be detected with multiplex assay.

 Ct values may vary from instrument to instrument by up to 2 cycles, while the interval between two
 dilutions steps is constant (ACt).

  SPECIFICITY
   Cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was tested with specimens known to be positive for
   a panel of respiratory viruses (influenza A(HlNl)pdmO9, A(H3N2), B-Victoria, B-Yamagata; influenza
   C; RSV A, B; hBoV; hPIV; hMPV; HRV/enterovirus; adenovirus; hCoV (HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63);
   MERS-CoV. None of the tested viruses showed reactivity with PCR2 and PCR4.


  POSITIVE CONTROL FOR SARS-CoV-2 REAL-TIME RT-PCR
  One specific control has been designated.

  Positive control for real-time RT-PCR is an in vitro transcribed RNA derived from strain
  BetaCoV_Wuhan_WIV04_2019 (EPI_ISL_402124). The transcript contains the amplification regions of
  the RdRp and E gene as positive strand. Each microtube contains 1011 copies of target sequences
  diluted in yeast tRNA, and lyophilised.


  Reconstitution of transcribed RNA
  Add 100 pl of RNase/DNAse-free H2O to obtain a solution at a concentration of 109 copies/pl. Store
  at -80°C. Dilute to prepare a master bank at 2xl06 copies/pl. Store at -80°C.
  From this prepare a working bank of reagent at 2xl04 copies/pl in order to avoid freeze/thaw
  cycles. Working tubes may be stored at -20°C for less than one week.

   Positive controls are available upon request (grippe@pasteur.fr)
