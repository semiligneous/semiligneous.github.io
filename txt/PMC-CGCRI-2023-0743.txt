On 1/07/211 had my Astra Zeneca covid vaccination. At the time was fit, healthy and strong. That
night I started to feel unwell and after 5 days with my health deteriorating my wife to my to our GP. I
collapsed at his clinic, and I was taken to hospital.

I was treated at the hospital, albeit nothing was done and then sent home.

I have attached my medical record. What I found disturbing was that I was diagnosed as described
with a virus -like illness. It was not. I had a direct adverse reaction to the vaccine. This was never
reported to the authorities.

Since then, I have never been the same. I have continuous bouts of a dry cough, runny nose and my
respiration has never been normal.

I had the vaccine to keep my moral judgement in line with the Health professionals of the time. What
a load of rubbish. I was injected with an untested vaccine that should never been approved, let alone
use me as a guinea pig. To protect us we were told.

And to protect who? Elderly people who may be susceptible to the effects of Covid all of whom have
since died anyway. And left those of us who were strong and healthy fighting the ongoing side effects
of a poison .

I look back on the con job the Government sold us with disgust.

Never again will I trust the 'Health Professionals' and their merry band of manipulating politicians.

And never again will I have a vaccination.
