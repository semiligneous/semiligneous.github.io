                  Commonwealth COVID-19 Response Inquiry


The Commonwealth Government is to be commended for trying to improve responses in the event
of future pandemics.

However:

This would require a more comprehensive Inquiry that includes the role of the States and Territories
and the role of the media.

The fearmongering in the media has had a detrimental effect on many citizens, even to the point of
suicide. Some of this fearmongering was presented by State Health Officials.

How well tested were responses to the pandemic? We are learning now from overseas studies that
some responses, such as mask- wearing were not effective, especially cheap masks, home-made
masks and masks worn under the chin.

So many reactions to the pandemic were initiated by State Governments - lockdowns, mandates,
mask wearing, travel restrictions, crossing into other States with border restrictions, school closures,
church closures - some of which were violations of citizens human rights - that an Inquiry without
investigating the implications of these factors will not go far enough.
