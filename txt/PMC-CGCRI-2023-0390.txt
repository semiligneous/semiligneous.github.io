As a community worker, I lost my job due to the push in this field to have workers
‘vaccinated’. I declined to have an experimental vaccine.

With a plan already in place in 2019, the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic
Influenza, I would like an enquiry as to why this wasn’t implemented. Who decided to do
opposite to this and therefore cause the government to take drastic measures which caused
hardship everywhere from mental health, to job losses. All these actions were far too
draconian.

I would therefore request a full Royal Commission with proper investigations into the
following areas:

 Vaccine procurement and secret vaccine contracts

 Vaccine mandates

  Vaccine injuries as many of my friends and some family have had reactions, some of whom
have passed away through turbo charged cancers, and thus the government misinformation in
the media regarding the ability of vaccines to block infection and transmission along with the
denial of these vaccine related injuries and gaslighting of the injured.

  Mask mandates and lockdowns

  The silencing of the medical profession due to AHPRA and ATAGI and these
organisations lack of due diligence on safety, and their silence on the harm caused by the
vaccine.

We need answers so this doesn’t happen again especially given the WHO wants to change
their constitution so they have complete control when ‘they’ call the next pandemic.
