I am strongly requesting a robust Royal Commission for an investigation into the now known
shocking statistics of excessive Covid-19 vaccine's deaths and injuries The attached government
Covid-19 compensation scheme is in itself enough evidence that the government acknowledges the
serious injuries and deaths caused by this vaccine. The population was rigorously urged, mandated
(yes, mandated for those who had no option due to job and income loss if they refused), coerced and
incentified without evidence of safety, conclusively evidenced by the known fact that the vaccine
was only provisionally approved, meaning it was not properly tested. It was released onto the public
with the full knowledge of the risks involved and instead of erring on the side of caution and
releasing the truth about the risks, the government instead decided to risk lives. Informed consent
protocols were certainly not followed. We are now seeing the eye-watering statistics of this most
dangerous vaccine. An investigation is the only option now as the public have the right to
understand the truth and the government must take responsibility for the damage that has been done.
