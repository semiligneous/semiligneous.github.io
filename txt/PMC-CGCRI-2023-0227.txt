SUMMARY

Safety warnings ignored by the Commonwealth, Health Depts./Ministers etc. including TGA (and AHPRA etc.) following
the publicly available European Medicines Agency Assessment Reports

Evidence from EMA website (3 links & HHreport image) listing identified safety risks & missing information (no data).

Research                             910 reported TGA DAEN cases of reactions (88% children affected) including 43
cases deemed "Serious" as per TGA FOI4769 (published 17/11/2023). Reported child jab deaths - all listed on TGA DAEN
and TGA FOI 3545, FOI 4077 and FOI 4769. GOVERNMENT PUBLIC DATA (DAMNING EVIDENCE OF JAB HARM).

Currently 139,579 adverse reactions cases listed on TGA DAEN following COVID-19 jabs from 21/12/2020 to
25/11/2023, including 5,863 cases reported of Australian children aged under 18. ReferTGA DAEN website as evidence.

 ,005 reported jab deaths on DAEN consisting of approx.                -/*£**"                                     m

Of these 1,005 COVID-19 jab reported deaths, |9 child reported deathj aged from 5 -17 (5 boys and 4 girls). See page 3.

JAB SAFETY WARNINGS IGNORED

The TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) provisionally approved the COVID-19 vaccinations, which were developed
and manufactured at 'warp speed' within approx. 9 months; whereas most vaccines take years for approval i.e. study trials,
long term data and safety assessments etc. For example, as from the 1st July, 2023, the TGA approved release of a vaccine,
called ^^^^for Australian babies aged 6 weeks old. It was initially assessed by the European Medicines Agency in their
report dated 17th December 2015, despite there being 7 baby deaths reported in the trial ("All vaccinated Subjects").
Refer page 124 as evidence of baby deaths plus safety concerns, identified risks and "Missing information" pages 128-130.


The COVID-19 global trial experimental vaccines were also assessed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) with reports
in early 2021, prior to the TGA giving "provisional approval' ahead of the jab rollout in Australia. Alarmingly, these 3
publicly-available reports showed SERIOUS safety concerns with important identified risks e.g. anaphylaxis and "Missing
information" (no data): • “Use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding • Use in immunocompromised patients • Use in
frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic neurological disease,
cardiovascular disorders) • Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders • Interactions with other vaccines
• Long-term safety". As researched evidence, see 3 x EMA assessment report links and 2 uploaded reports (highlighted
pages - quick scrolling) as part of submission. See page no's for key information. Safety concerns image |

                     Safety Specification

                     Summary of safety concerns

                     The applicant has submitted an RMP including the following summary of safety concerns:

                      Important identified risks        Anaphylaxis

                      Important potential risks         Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) including Vaccine-
                                                        associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD)

                      Missing information               Use during pregnancy and while breast feeding

                                                        Use in immunocompromised patients

                                                        Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (e.g. chronic obstructive
                                                        pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease,
                                                        cardiovascular disorders)

                                                        Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders

                                                        Interaction with other vaccines

                                                        Long term safety data



                     Risks considered important for inclusion of the summary of safety concerns

                     The review of available safety data, including post-marketing data emerging from use in the UK and
                     US, the experience with biological products and other vaccines leads to the conclusion that anaphylaxis
                     is an important identified risk for^^^^^^lThis safety concern will be followed up via routine
                     pharmacovigilance activities and in the planned and ongoing safety studies and reported in the
                     monthly summary safety reports and PSURs.

                     Any important potential risks that may be specific to vaccination for COVID-19 (e.g. vaccine associated
                     enhanced respiratory disease) should be taken into account. The Applicant has included VAED/VAERD
                     as an important potential risk and will further investigate it in the ongoing pivotal study and a post­
                     authorisation safety study.

                     Missing information

                     Since pregnant and breast-feeding women were excluded from the study, no information is available
                     for those populations. It is agreed to include use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding as missing
                     information in the RMP.

                     At the data cut-off of 14 Nov-20, 10-14 weeks safety data are available. Thus, long-term safety is
                     included as missing information and will be characterised as part of the continuation of the pivotal
                     clinical trial and the PASS.

                     Interaction with other vaccines, has not been evaluated in clinical trials and may be of interest to
                     prescribers. As elderly individuals will be one target group for vaccination, and they often may need
                     vaccination with other vaccines such as influenza and pneumococcus vaccines, further data is

  E(           VTIONS - Key health response measures (COVID-19 vaccinations & public health messaging).
1. Stop the fearmongering of COVID. Start changing public health messaging from wrongful narrative 'safe and effective'.
2. Stop giving "provisional approval" a.k.a. 'back-door' access to Pharmaceuticals via the TGA. Start with adopting a 'safe
     passage' procedure and being thoroughly vigilant with reading assessment reports, studying trial information and
     long-term safety data of vaccines (and medicines). NB.             as rejected in USA as an unsafe product 1960's.
3. Stop all conflict of interests involving funds being given from 'big Pharma' to TGA and Governments etc.
4. Stop giving legal indemnity to pharmaceutical companies. Change the conditions or refuse these commercial contracts
     that have bound up the Commonwealth (including 'rogue' State/Territory Governments). Ensure proper and easier
     compensation channels for the jab-injured and families of the jab-deceased; with transparency and compassion.
