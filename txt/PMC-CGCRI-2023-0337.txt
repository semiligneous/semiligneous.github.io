                           Submission to COVID Inquiry December 2023
Who I am
I am a psychologist in private practice and I have been working for over 30 years. I have worked in
government, non government, private and community organisations as well as solo private practice. My
experience has been as a clinician, a Manager, Executive Manager, Local and also State representative
on National committees across many fields including the disability sector and mental health.
Covid presented challenges that were unprecedented for myself as a practitioner and also the people I
provide a service to. These challenges can be summed up by the following:
Issues and background
   •   I was also living through the pandemic and all the concerns and precautions that included - while
       also caring for my elderly mother and trying to keep her safe and my brother who developed
       serious health issues during covid and they remain and he can no longer work.
   •   As a sole practitioner service provider I had to navigate all the changes as they occurred at very
       short notice - this added an extra level of stress and admin and increased my work hours
   •   We had to find ways to move to telehealth and find platforms that complied with all of the privacy
       and security laws at very short notice and we had to pay for these on top of our usual business
       costs
   •   For a period we were told we had to bulk bill all clients - this didn’t cover costs and set up
       expectations with clients that we had to continually change as the rules changed, including
       managing non vaxed clients.
   •   When we could return to face to face there were many additional costs including PRE, sanitiser,
       air purifiers, extra cleaning between clients etc
   •   People were in a tough place with the start of the pandemic - however they seemed to have
       more severe issues in 2022 and this continued this year. Partly as a cumulative impact of many
       impacts of the pandemic along with people being very tired and stressed from years of managing.
   •   People being in lockdown, losing loved ones, losing their jobs, being ostracised due to not being
       vaccinated were all additional issues
   •   People were not only having issues at home and in their personal lives but also at work where
       there was a noticeable increase in workplace stress across the board.
   •   We have supported people through the many natural disasters that have occurred simultaneously
       with covid.
   •   The increase in transphobia has left many trans and gender questioning people feeling even
       more unsafe than before. Practitioners who work with this population also fear for their clients
       and for themselves professionally.
   •   The reduction of Medicare sessions from 20 to 10 at short notice while many were on leave made
       it difficult to prepare for the start of the year and meant most had to do some work in their
       holidays to stay informed.
   •   The 10 sessions left people with not even 1 session per month if they started in January - this
       was not adequate for maintenance let alone doing therapeutic work.
   •   Add in the massive financial impact on people this year and there wasn’t an option for most to
       fund private sessions - leaving us helping people limp along without being able to offer a lot of
       practical assistance.
   •   There has been a significant increase in difficulty with getting rentals during the pandemic in WA,
       and an increase in homelessness. I have had a number of homeless people I have supported
       over this time and as a result the only option is to bulk bill them.
   •   People wait years even if they are on the urgent list. If they make a change to the area they
       would like to reside in due to having supports around them they are then placed on the bottom of
       the new waitlist - surely if you have waited then there is a better way. Without an address, people
       find it difficult to get work and then get hassled by Centrelink as well.
   •   We have supported the health professionals who had very high stress levels due to their working
       conditions and the risks they faced.
   •   The whole area around neurodivergence has exploded and changed during covid - the rules
       around who can do what (with an evidence base) are unclear; there are different rules for
       different bodies; and there is a severe lack of both psychiatrists and pediatricians in South West
       WA leaving people without the ability to get a formal diagnosis.
  •   There continues to be a split in recognition in psychology and this has limited the access for
      clients to well trained and experiences psychological helps for no evidence based reason.
  •   I am seeing people now who have long covid with significant and debilitating health issues. There
      appear to be limited long covid clinics around or information available for people.
  •   Practitioners have worked harder during the pandemic than ever to assist clients, the community
      and to keep going, while also living through the issues everyone else has lived through. Many
      have ended up with health issues themselves and burnout. To date we have not had any support
      from government in the way of recognising we are a valued resource. Sessions were reduced
      expecting us to do more with less, and comments were made from the Better Access review that
      made no sense and did not have an evidence base. For eg government said that people in need
      did not receive access to services with the extra 10 sessions. People did get access to services,
      the majority of people still access less than 6 sessions, those with severe or complex needs will
      use the 20 easily. It makes no sense to offer more people less of a service in an effort to get more
      people through the door. As it was well put many months ago - you don’t offer half a course of
      antibiotics to 2 people - it is a waste of money and ineffective - you offer people a full course of
      treatment when they need it, then you can move to less frequent sessions
  •   In 2023 for some reason Medicare rebates have taken between 2 and 6 weeks to process - this
      has had a huge impact on low income earners and has further pushed out their ability to attend
      sessions. If the rebate is processed by practitioners then the rebate is instant - we have to pay
      for those systems so that is a cost shift and one that not everyone has access to.
  •   There has been an increase in issues of cybersecurity requiring additional checks and balances
      and also an increase in insurance premiums
  •   There have been a multitude of very significant reviews and studies undertaken over the past few
      years - each time (like with this one) we get asked to provide input - to do it comprehensively
      and with references etc - this is all in addition to the significant amount of unpaid admin we have
      to do currently under Medicare, NDIS and various other referral systems.
  •   Since the pandemic - the majority of providers have been booked out months ahead - yet we
      continue to get told of online events that are being held a couple of weeks in advance during
      work time. When nearly every event ends up being during work time in WA - it is almost
      impossible to plan to go back and view them all especially when many aren’t recorded.
Recommendations
  •   Allow people to provide information in whatever way they can - without the added impost of
      having to do a formal submission - none of us have time for that
  •   Recognise mental health professionals have had a huge part to play in getting the country
      through covid and we have done that with virtually no help at all from government or elsewhere
  •       Leave Medicare sessions at 20 until a new plan is in place
  •   Increase the Medicare rebate so practitioners can afford to bulk bill those who can’t pay
      especially during this current financial climate
  •   Have a national system that allows a rapid turnaround for medicare rebates regardless of the
      system used
  •   Have a single secure messaging system that all health professionals can use to transfer
      information
  •   Be aware that the impacts of covid are long term and will have consequences if services are not
      able to support them adequately
  •       Provide more long covid clinics and information
  •   Squash hate talk and anti-trans rhetoric including legislation about religious schools being
      allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexuality and gender
  •       Clarify and simplify the rules around assessing and diagnosing for ADHD and Autism
  •       Find ways to increase the number of Psychiatrists and Pediatricians in South West WA
  •   End the two tier system in psychology to make the most of the workforce that is available and so
      desperately needed.
  •   Provide information to professionals in a timely manner - it is not acceptable to notify people of a
      change in rules 2 weeks before they come into effect on 1 January. This does not allow people to
      give information to clients and plan sessions accordingly
  •       Provide multiple times for information sessions that include out of hours options for WA
  •       Allow provisional psychologists to charge and get a Medicare rebate
  •       Assist provisional psychologists to get placements - currently it is a huge cost to the individual
