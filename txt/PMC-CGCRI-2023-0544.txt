The erosion of public trust in vaccination can be attributed to a combination of factors involving health
authorities, politicians, influential organizations, and pharmaceutical companies. These entities engaged
in actions that undermined confidence in the vaccination process. They concealed Western-backed gain-
of-function research, provided misinformation about the origins of Covid, disseminated false videos, and
labeled inquiries into the Chinese government's actions as 'racist.'

Additionally, they exaggerated risks to healthy individuals, included children and infants in experimental
vaccine trials, bypassed standard testing procedures, and downplayed known side effects. The deliberate
use of fear tactics, the rushed approval of mRNA vaccines with serious side effects, and the compulsory
vaccination of large populations further fueled skepticism.

Moreover, they implemented coercive measures such as pressuring businesses, ransoming family
members, and using social media to silence dissent. Instances of concealing adverse effects, withholding
compensation, and allowing secret contracts with vaccine manufacturers raised ethical concerns. The
creation of a 'health passport' and a global check-in system violated privacy laws, while the demonization
of vaccine skeptics through propaganda and the freezing of bank accounts intensified public discontent.

The political exploitation of the situation, expansion of legislative powers, and violations of constitutional
agreements, such as closing state borders, added to the public's unease. Finally, the inclusion of these
vaccines in childhood compulsory schedules appeared to be a strategic move to quell further scrutiny.

The collective impact of these actions has understandably led to a significant loss of public confidence in
health advice and vaccination programs.

We need a full Royal Commission into the Governments response to Covid, no less.
