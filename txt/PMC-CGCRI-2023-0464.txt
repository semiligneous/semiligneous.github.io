                              SUBMISSION RE COVID19 INQUIRY

In addressing the call for submissions for the Covid Inquiry from the Office of Prime Minister
and Cabinet, the issues needed to be investigated are as follows:

   •   Transparency in covid contracts between organizations including pharmaceutical
       companies
   •       Vaccine data on mortality rates
   •       Mask mandates
   •       Lockdowns
   •       Misinformation in media regarding the ability of vaccines to block transmissions
   •       Vaccine injuries
   •       Media censorship relating to vaccines and their effects
   •   Silencing of doctors and other qualified personnel such as independent scientists,
       epidemiologists and the like
   •       The lack of openness for scientific and medical debate
   •   The role of AHPRA and ATAGI in censorship and oppression of doctors poor treatment of
       vaccine injured victims
   •       The harassment of family members by hospitals
   •       Border closures preventing families seeing their loved ones, sick or not

Personally, I was




The lockdowns particularly
                 Working from home was difficult and^^^^^^^g in particular, became
depressed due to a lack of social interaction and physical exercise that boys are accustomed to.
A typical comment was, "Every day is the same..." This lead to withdrawal and a quietness I had
not previously seen. I was concerned.

During the pandemic, I                                                  The strict, ridiculous
rules prevented us from seeing our loved ones, whether it was the nursing home, rehabilitation
centers or eventually, hospitals being the worst experiences. One hospital played cat and
mouse in allowing us in. A female doctor would try to call me four times a day to ensure I had
completed my rat tests, wasn't she supposed to be run off her feet dealing with patients?
When I ignored her calls, she harassed^^^^^M regarding her issues with me! At that same
hospital - Boxhill hospital,          should have been released from the covid ward after
seven days so                                                                                Only
then were the team to meet to discuss his release.                             He was kept
there longer so the hospital could claim the covid payment, in which his covid was over.

In addition to the above, the funeral company charged u                   to have the coffin
open (we are Greek), as
The whole covid experience was heart breaking for my family and so many people nationally.

Governments and affiliates MUST be investigated. A Royal Commission Inquiry into Covid is
required and demanded by the people of Australia
