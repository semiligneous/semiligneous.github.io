          Australians for
          Pandemic Prevention


Dear Independent Panel,

When the Prime Minister and Health Minister announced the Commonwealth
Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry, they said the next pandemic is
inevitable.1 In our view, nothing about pandemics is so inevitable that we should
rely only on mitigating the risk, rather than seeking to prevent it with concrete
interventions at multiple levels.

Prevention is almost certain to be more cost-effective than "wait and respond".2
We can reduce the chance that pathogens with pandemic potential emerge and,
even if they do, we can also reduce the chance that they turn into pandemics.

Combined domestic action and global leadership is our path to a future without
pandemics.



Primary prevention - natural, accidental
and intentional
There are a limited number of ways a pandemic can begin, and practical
interventions on multiple levels across science, public health and communication
can reduce their likelihood.

Zoonoses have been the major cause of pandemics3 and climate change is
intensifying their risk.4 Australia is a large and biodiverse country with significant
factory farming, interdependence on the global animal trade,5 deforestation and
habitat loss, and a track record of zoonoses - including Hendra virus6 and
Australian bat lyssavirus.7 The next pandemic-causing organism could originate
here.

Australia's international statements and biosecurity strategies acknowledge the
risk of zoonoses and promote a One Health approach.8 But they do not actively
address the factors that predispose a pathogen to spread to new populations
and locations or aim to reduce high-risk interactions - including between
humans, domesticated animals, and wild animals.9 Australian governments
should:

   1.   Affirm that the Australian Centre for Disease Control should prioritise the
        prevention of pandemics - natural, accidental and intentional.

   2.      Implement practical measures to reduce the risk of zoonoses.



                                                                                         1

Zoonoses are not the only risk. While Australia must keep punching above its
weight in pathogen research,10 biosafety and dual-use research are genuine
concerns.

Unfortunately, biosafety incidents happen,11 including in Australia,12 and as recently
as this year.13 Our risk mitigations need to be effective, innovative and account for
the potential global consequences if the worst were to happen. Risk also comes
from the knowledge and technology necessary for engineered pathogens
becoming more widely available.14 Open publication practices and Al may
accelerate these trends.15 Australian governments should:

   3. Review biosafety practices and requirements for research involving
      human or animal pathogens, at a laboratory and national level, to ensure
      any balancing of risk properly accounts for the global consequences of
      incidents.

   4. Develop a framework to safeguard against engineered pandemics,
      including enhancing access controls and screening for certain
      technologies, such as high-risk synthetic DNA.16



Early detection and control of novel
pathogens
While preventing novel pathogens from emerging is ideal, early detection and
control can halt outbreaks before they become a pandemic.


Early detection
Early detection allows better response. Ideally, any potential pandemic pathogen
would be identified and understood early enough that it can be contained and
eliminated via rapid escalation at the first sign of an outbreak. Developing field
and lab-based technologies, including metagenomics-enabled microbial
surveillance, may be ready to make this a reality.17 The same technology would
have co-benefits, allowing Australia to unlock promising use cases including in
agriculture, precision medicine and combating the impact of climate change and
antimicrobial resistance on disease outcomes.18 Australian governments should:




                                                                                     2

   5. Operate and coordinate pathogen-agnostic metagenomic surveillance
      in strategic locations - like aviation wastewater19 and human-livestock
       interfaces - to allow the early identification and assessment of novel
       pathogens.20

   6. Develop and regularly exercise a national plan to contain and eliminate
       novel pathogen outbreaks with pandemic potential.


Indoor air quality as a public health strategy
While clean water has been a public health priority for almost 200 years, the
importance of clean air was undervalued pre-COVID-19. As respiratory viruses
spread rapidly, widespread implementation of existing and emerging air filtration
and pathogen inactivation technologies may slow the spread of a novel
pathogen and provide time for early detection and medical and human
interventions to translate into effective action. Improving indoor air quality would
both aid pandemic prevention and provide additional health, educational and
economic benefits.21 Australian governments should:

   7. Develop an indoor air quality strategy with practical measures to make
      indoor air safer, including implementing mature technologies in
      high-risk settings.22

   8. Fund research into promising pathogen reduction technologies,
      including far-UVC light, and evolve the indoor air quality strategy as new
      technology becomes available.

COVID-19 showed us that the human, social and economic costs of pandemics
are catastrophic, and that willingness to act on the advice of experts was critical
to good outcomes.23 These eight recommendations, implemented nationally and
promoted globally through capacity-building efforts, could substantially reduce
the rate at which pandemics occur. With the right ambition, COVID-19 could be
humanity's last pandemic.


Yours Faithfully,
