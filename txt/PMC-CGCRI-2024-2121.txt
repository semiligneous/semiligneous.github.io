             Efficacy, “protection” and vaccination to prevent COVID-19

The public appears to have a poor understanding of “protection” as encompassed by the term
“efficacy” in regard to vaccination against COVID-19. In mid-2021 I polled 24 individuals drawn
from family, friends, neighbours, my accountant, librarians, recent medical graduates, University
students and one random stranger. The question was:

“What do you think 95 percent vaccine protection against COVD-19 means”? Answers
included:

“Vaccination prevents COVID 95 times out of 100”.
“If I get COVID, it will be 95 percent less severe”.
“I’m protected 95 percent of the time”.
“Vaccinated people have only a 1/20 chance of getting COVID”.
“The vaccine lowers the viral load by 95 percent”.
“I don’t know what it means”.

None are correct - a plaint to science communication and investigative journalism. This may
explain what prompted the WHO to advise, “An efficacy of 80% does not mean that 20% of the
vaccinated group will become ill”. The WHO declined to tell us what efficacy does mean. What
the WHO did say is, “If a vaccine has high efficacy, a lot fewer people in the group who
received the vaccine got sick than the people in the group who received the placebo” [1], The
WHO is either confused or obfuscating. It is not “a lot fewer people”. It is less than 1 percent
people.

Nonetheless, the common thread seems to be that something worthwhile stands behind a
number as high as 95 percent. And as such, “protection” signifies a welcome and markedly
reduced risk of acquiring COVID-19 in a vaccinated individual. Likewise, one should worry
when vaccine-induced immunity wanes overtime [2],

What people desire (but may not express) is, “How less likely am I to get COVID-19 if I am
vaccinated? This is called the absolute risk reduction (ARR). Efficacy does not measure ARR
and cannot be calculated from it. This is because efficacy is computed from a comparison of
the fraction of vaccinated who get COVID-19 relative to the fraction of unvaccinated who get
COVID-19. In other words, efficacy is contingent on getting COVID-19.

The original Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 Comirnaty randomised placebo controlled trial (RCT)
was published in the NEJM on December 31st 2020 [3], 36,523 participants were split almost
equally into a vaccinated and a saline, unvaccinated, control group. At 60 days there were 170
cases of symptomatic, PCR-confirmed COVID-19. 8/18,198 (0.04 percent) occured in those
vaccinated and 162/18,325 (0.88 percent) in those given saline. Compared to the saline group,
5 percent (0.04/0.88, 1 /20th) of the vaccinated group got COVID-19.

Since humans are more favourably disposed towards success than failure, efficacy (protection)
is expressed as 95 percent rather than 5 percent. The analogous situation is framing a surgical
procedure with a 5 percent mortality rate as a 95 percent survival rate. It is believed patients
are less likely to reject an operation when presented with the latter.

Assuming, as we must, that vaccination and control groups were at similar risk of acquiring
SARS-CoV-2 and getting COVID-19, casting efficacy as “protection” loses sight of the fact that
                                                                                         Page | 2


neither vaccine nor saline “protected” the 18,163 of the 18,325 in the placebo group who did not
get symptomatic COVID-19. The remedy for assessing the absolute risk reduction of acquiring
COVID-19 is to count bodies and deduct, rather than computing proportions of those who
succumbed to COVID-19.

In the Pfizer trial, 99.96 percent of those vaccinated did not get COVID-19.
In the Pfizer trial, 99.12 percent of those saline-ated did not get COVID-19.

The difference between the two is the absolute risk reduction. In this case,    84 percent.

This is 113 times smaller than the 95 percent “protection” statistic. It also implies that 119
people had to be vaccinated in order to prevent one case of COVID-19. (0.84 percent = 1/119).
This statistic is called the number needed to treat (NNT).

Note: Virus transmission and asymptomatic infections were not outcome measures in the Pfizer
trial.

In the 2015 U.S. Communicating Risks and Benefits: An Evidence-Based User’s Guide, the
FDA state, “Provide absolute risks, not just relative risks. Patients are unduly influenced
when risk information is presented using a relative risk approach; this can result in suboptimal
decisions” (FDA emphasis). Presumably “suboptimal” cautions physicians against denying
patients data necessary for making personal choices for or against vaccination [4].

In 201                      and his colleagues warned of dangers communicating information
solely in terms of relative risk. One example they gave was a 1995 caution issued by the UK
Committee on Safety of Medicines. It was stated, “that third generation oral contraceptive pills
increased the risk of potentially life threatening thrombosis twofold. The news provoked great
anxiety, and many women stopped taking the pill, which led to unwanted pregnancies and
abortions—some 13 000 additional abortions in the next year in England and Wales—and an
extra £46m (€55m; $71 m) in costs for the NHS”. However, the twofold relative risk increase
was an absolute increase from 1/7000 with the second generation pill to 2/7 ) with the third
generation pill [5].              regards this a moral issue and concluded, “The problem of
misleading reporting has not gone away”. In 2021 it had still “not gone away”. Only then the
moral issues included, inter alia, whether to decline vaccination or lose one’s livelihood.

Saline placebos
One assumes that vaccine scientists and manufacturers conduct RCTs to prove that the active
ingredient is responsible for the observed effects. RCTs are experiments. All experiments
require a control / placebo to mitigate known and unknown confounding factors. To put it
another way, without a valid control it is impossible to ascertain whether or not the outcome of
interest is a pure effect of the entity under test. The Pfizer entity is an mRNA that codes for the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In this regard, perhaps too little attention has been given to the
choice and dosing of placebos in the Pfizer (and other) COVID-19 vaccine trials.

1. Normal saline is arguably an adequate control for addressing local problems. That is,
   effects wrought by injury to skin, subcutaneous tissue, blood vessels, muscle, introduced
   microorganisms, the transient passage of a metallic foreign body and local vaccine
   reactogenicity.
2. A few cubic millimetres of an injected, salt / water mixture is not expected to mirror the
   diverse systemic, ongoing immunogenic events of a vaccine mixture. (Although Pfizer
   thouoht otherwise:

3. Attributing vaccine efficacy to the mRNA component of a COVID-19 vaccine requires a
   placebo whose composition is identical to the vaccine minus the mRNA. Compare COVj
   19 vaccinations with, for example, the trial of measles vaccination conducted in 1975
           and co eaoues:

                                   [7], Controlling for this possibility requires substituting the
   vaccine lipid nanoparticle / simian adenovirus vector nucleic acid with unrelated nucleic acid
   species which itself, and its product, are judged harmless._________________________
5. In regard to mRNA vaccines,
                                                                                     [SJ- What is
   understood is that vaccine lipids and mRNA themselves are foreign and thus potential
   antigens. Unless individual constituents of the lipid nanoparticles remain invisible to the
   adaptive immune system, there is a theoretical possibility that vaccines induce antibodies
   reactive against mRNA. Such may impair the PCR testing required to diagnose COVID-19
   in symptomatic participants. If so, the number of COVID-19 cases in both vaccinated and
   unvaccinated groups may be underestimated.

If one were conducting a two month RCT to evaluate a drug treatment for hypertension, the
placebo would be given every day for the duration of the study. Given the duration of COVID-19
vaccine RCTs is typically 60 days, for 59/60 days these experiments were uncontrolled (58/60 if
one includes the 300 fewer individuals who received a second injection in the Pfizer study). The
use of an ephemeral, non-immunogenic control is not a fair test of the active ingredient’s ability
to reduce the relative and absolute risks of symptomatic COVID-19.

Compared to measles vaccination, with an NNT of 1-2 persons, there seems little basis for the
third word of the COVID-19 vaccination mantra, “safe and effective”. “Safe” is not addressed in
this essay.
