I have been a nurse for 26yrs, 20 of those years were
During the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, I worked frontline looking after patients in ED, Operating
Theatres and Recovery. I volunteered to help out in the ICU if needed and was given a 2 day
upskilling in ventilators course. The course is usually 12 months. Despite this daunting reality I did
it to make sure I could helpas much as possible even though the thought was
terrifying especially with the fear campaign of the media showing what was happening overseas.
It was at great cost to my family also as believe it or not I was denied PRE whilst looking after a
patient who had had major head and neck surgery and was coughing profusely, despite all doctors
around me wearing a mask. I was told they were ‘saving’ the masks. In Dedication to my job and
caring for this patient, I stayed at great risk to myself and family as he had Covid symptoms.

I would come home from a long day at work sometimes not getting a break and remove my ___
uniform into a bucket of disinfectant under our house and go straight to the shower, not letting
         touch me until I was finished.

The clapping and the label of ‘hero’ was short lived.



          found myself in a predicament of risking my own heath seriously with a potentially fatal
outcome by receiving the Covid vaccination or dealing with the cold and flu symptoms of Covid
and isolating for 1-2 weeks.
The choice was easy for me, I would maintain high levels of PRE and hand washing and social
distancing, reducing my chances of catching Covid by 97% instead of risking the life ending or life
changing risk of
Unfortunatel^^ecam^leaKhe vaccination which for 12 months was only recommended in
emails from                        to Mandates and strong arm, bullying tactics^^h^executive
team. This included singling out those that remained unvaccinated                          in an
email that told all staff that they would be able to know who remained unvaccinated by the fact the
he was now making them                                            11 day at work. This was in
summer. I emailed him this glaringly obvious consequence of his directive but he never
responded. The study he used to justify this was completely inadequate and admitted by the
authors that their health care workers vaccinated and unvaccinated caught Covid and spread
Covid at the same rate.
The emails kept coming, shaming staff saying they were a danger to their colleagues for remaining
unvaccinated which had not been proven, fuelling more hatred to those of us aware of the_____
increasing adverse events that were taking

Luckily^^^^^^^^^^Mwastotallysympathetictomypliqhta ndhelpedwhere she could, but
when the date of^^^^/vas given I could no longer step foot in           health facility.
I worked from home doing pre and post procedure phone calls along with package updates etc.
I received 4 show cause letters saying I had committed ‘gross misconduct’ and will be punished
accordingly, being threatened with 6 months jail time and/or large fines.

I am a caring dedicated and respectful person who has dedicated my life to looking after others at
great risk to myself.________
I am appalled                    ridiculing on tv saying the unvaccinated will be hunted down. The
minister saying we are a waste of oxygen and the executives at^^^^^^|saying we are a
danger to the community. All since proven incorrect.
The narrative has changed about the vaccine after it proved to be less than effective. People were
guilted into getting it to ‘protect grandma’ when they said the vaccine would stop you getting Covid
and stop you spreading it, now slowly they’re now saying it won’t stop you getting Covid or
spreading it. This was the basis of the mandates and now that has been admitted to be incorrect,
                   the executive health teams refuse to admit they were wrong, instead gaslighting
nurses, doctors and allied health workers. And refusing to drop the mandates even though in
doing so they could alleviate the Health hospital Emergency the hospitals are in by allowing the
thousands of workers who were stood down without pay to return to work and do what they do
best! Looking after the sick and supporting their colleagues.

Please don’t hesitate to call me for any more information.


I have rang^^^^^^^office with my plight but it has fallen on deaf ears.
I was fired and I cannot access unemployment benefits, it’s like they are trying to bankrupt and
render us homeless in a spiteful and callous way.

The lockouts were overreach and unconstitutional, and reminiscent of locking out the ‘unclean’
                             based on sketchy at best science.

The vaccine Mandates are still going on despite the Premier dropping them. Please ask the HHS’s
who still have their and to this day are still firing frontline health care workers based on
unscientific, highly exaggerated and fear mongering misinformation.

Kind reaards
