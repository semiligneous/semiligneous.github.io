Submissions and evidence to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry


Dear COVID-19 Response Inquiry Taskforce and Inquiry Panel,

The last three years and the approach taken by State and federal Government has not only left many
in shock but also bereaved through loosing loved ones or dealing with injuries of loved ones.

As you are aware Melbourne had one of the harshest, longest lockdown in the world and I watched
with horror the impact on young people in our community and beyond. It lead to me to actively
reach out to Members of Parliament to warn them of the consequences providing substantiating
data and research already coming out of Europe and from the United Nations. All of this was kindly
ignored by all but one Member of Parliament and the then Prime Ministers Office. The Member of
Parliament who was most active presented the information in the Victoria Parliament only to be
shouted down. Sadly we are seeing the consequences of the long unnecessary Victorian lockdowns
on kids, young people, businesses and in all honesty the wider community.

That was only the start. Iwas medical advised to due to my multiple medical / biological conditions
including                                             and                       to medication, that
the new vaccines would be a high risk for me. I am what government, media and the incited public
called the "unvaccinated" or when they are really vicious "anti-vaxxer", odd really considering I have
had lots of other inactivated vaccines and my ^^^^Htwo pages worth of childhood and travel
vaccines. But it suited to narrative to demonise anyone who was not vaccinated with the newly
formulated Covid-19 vaccines.

I was told that in Victoria I was not allowed an exemption due the Victorian government, health
department and APRHA. I was to have the first dose in a high risk setting in case something went
wrong. As a^^^ I politely declined as it wasn't worth the risk of an
which I was already at risk at with                                  further aggravating one of my
               o n d i t i o n s.

Due to not taking the risk, I was banned from work, restaurants, cafes, sports, travel etc etc. until
July 2022.
I am incredibly thankful to the medical advice I received, as my^^^|had three doses and the third
one took her life. She developed                     was unable to                              died
weighing^^l Her funeral was                             last year and Christmas will never be the same
again. Death certificate can be provided on request.

M            is also vaccine injured. Following her mandated vaccination,
        something that she had never experienced before. On the advice of a doctors, this year she
saw a                  ho ran numerous tests including a|                          test which shows
               and thereby|          (https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22681-anti-
mullerian-hormone-test). We were shocked to find out that our                           has the
of a             Results can be provided on request.
For he              my           banned all her baby and childhood photos being shown, with the
thought that she may never have children this was something she couldn't bring herself to look at.
As a^H^|who had only months earlier lost her^^| to watch your^^Hgo through this is
heartbreaking.

That is the result of a one size fits all approach, I was segregated, vilified and banned, my       is
injured, my^^His dead leaving behinc^^^^^^^^^^^^H

As someone very connected to community, there are many who talk about injuries from the
vaccines and who are angry about the mandates and lockdowns. They were forced to take a medical
procedure that did not deliver what they were promised, some are injured or have lost loved ones,
but the bigger issue is the forced lockdowns, the forced vaccination all of which did not protect
them, instead harmed the state, the communities and families.

This inquiry needs to look at the following:
    -        Failure to manage hotel quarantine
    -        Failure to manage aged care
    -        State lockdowns
    -        State mandates
    -        Lack of exemptions
    -        Lack of acknowledgement of the harm caused



I ask you to please follow a proper investigation not just a rubber stamp white wash. Governments
are elected to serve the people not harm people and then pretend it didn't happen.

Kind Regards
