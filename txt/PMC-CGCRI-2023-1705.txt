    I am a principal. Teaching over twenty years. I declined the vaccine and used up all my long service leave and sick
        leave when I was not allowed to work. I got an exemption but my boss/ area manager, would not allow me
       to return to work. Mandates ended and I was still not allowed to return to my job. I was offered a lessor
        position, which I declined. The stress, discrimination, harassment, bullying I have experienced due to
       government policy and government organizations has been horrendous. The discrimination and harassment
        continued long after covid was over, and I have only just now been offered a job again at my level. I have
        survived, thank God but the cost to me finically, emotionally, and professionally has be insurmountable.

   -   An open inquiry needs to happen (royal commission) - why were politicians allowed to openly encourage
        discrimination, hate, segregation and forced vaccines?
   -   Why were all foster children mandated to have the vaccines?
   -   Validate the data collected - who actually died of covid instead of With covid?
   -    Make available data for who is affected by adverse reactions to the vaccine.
   -   Anyone in any position who forced another, using any method of coercive behaviour needs to be held
        accountable. This needs to be made public.
   -         All sick leave and long service leave people were forced to take needs to be returned.
   -   All unpaid leave people were forced to take needs to be paid in full/ without tax as compensation for the
        discrimination and hate that was targeted at them by the government.
   -         All positions people were forced to leave should be reinstated.
   -         Unions let everyone down.



Next time:

   -         The response taken to COVID should NEVER be taken again. It was a complete overreach.
   -         No mandates
   -         No boarder closures
   -         No hate speech fromgovernment representatives.
   -         Free medical choice for every person.
   -         No targeting vulnerable groups.
   -         No rush in and mandating experimental drugs.
   -         No loss of employment due to medical choices.
   -         No closing down free speech.
   -   No threatening doctors / health professionals that they will lose their jobs if they do not stick with the
       government narrative.
   -         Universities should not limit access to students based on medical choices.
   -         Media should be held responsible for what they report. No hate speech or discrimination should be allowed.
   -   Reasonable and respectful choices should be available to those who want them, for example, if you want to
       work from home, that should be an option. BUT if you want to continue working in the workplace that also
        should be an option.
   -         No building 'health Camps' with public money. This is public money.
   -         No locking people up against their will.
   -         No locking people up against their will and then making them pay for it.
   -       No making million dollar deals with pharmaceutical companies in the middle of a health panic. This is public
        money.

I cannot believe that society fell so quickly to embrace hate and discrimination. Basic human rights were ignored and
segregation/ discrimination were celebrated.
