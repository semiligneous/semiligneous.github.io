Please consider recommendations relating to:
    1. Don't downplay how effective border closures were at protecting the WA
       community for such a long period of time.
          • Being able to work, interact and socialise freely without the heightened
             risk of long term impacts to yourself or loved ones.
          • We shouldn't be criticising WA for their effective policy which
             benefitted the vast majority.
   2.     Recognise there is an Issue:
          • Let's admit there's a serious problem with covid. We need everyone to
             understand why it's crucial to change what we're doing.
          • So much research makes it clear that every covid infection damages
             our bodies, even in young and healthy people. It's been obvious for a
             while now. Check out these examples from 2020 and 2021:
                 . Link 1
                 . Link 2
          • The Inquiry should look at this evidence and tell us to stop being so
             relaxed about covid.
   3.     Mandating Air Quality Standards:
          • Since we know more about how covid spreads through the air, we can
             make public places safer by improving ventilation. States should
             upgrade schools and hospitals, and the Federal government should set
             standards. Belgium's got a good model for air quality laws: Link
          • This would help with so many issues, not just covid.
   4.     Spreading Knowledge about covid transmission:
          • Right now, everyone's being told to wash their hands, but that doesn't
             do much against an airborne virus.
          • It's sad seeing people wiping down grocery carts when they're not
             wearing masks, which actually helps.
          • Public health needs to clue everyone in on how covid really spreads, so
             businesses and schools that want to do the right thing can take better
             actions.
   5.     Improved Access to Vaccines for All:
          • Recent research shows the older vaccines aren't cutting it. Australia
             needs to hustle and get the latest vaccines out to everyone, including
             kids, every six months.
          • The evidence says everyone over six months old should get the newest
             vaccines, looking at the long-term effects of covid, not just the
             immediate stuff.
          • Australia's vaccine strategy, especially for kids, is just weird. Kids under
             five with no risk factors can't get vaccines, even though they end up in
             the hospital more.
          •   New research shows getting vaccinated cuts the risk of long covid by
              about 70%. We should be thinking about the long-term effects, not just
              how many people end up in the hospital.
          •   It's not cool that some of us are denied the latest vaccines even if we
              want to pay for them ourselves.
          •   I also find it strange that we mandate vaccines for conditions that pose
              lower or equal threats to covid on our youngest yet don't allow them to
              have access to a covid vaccine to help protect them
