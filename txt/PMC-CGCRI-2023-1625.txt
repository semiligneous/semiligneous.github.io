Commonwealth Government CO VID-19 Response Inquiry- submission

This inquiry is unlikely to improve public confidence in the Australian governance. Three pages is
not enough space to seriously look at the deeply flawed issues of the interventions, certainly we
cannot address the egregious behaviour of government in any serious way.
A) The response was based around the reliance of a product that did not go through long term
testing. We were told the products were natural and would be out of the body within days. A study
from August 2023 has found on testing the blood of individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2
that vaccinal spike protein was present in the blood of 50% of those tested, for between 69 and 187
days.1 An independent paper published this month2 is showing more than 1 in 4 people who have
been vaccinated with mRNA “vaccines” experience a misprinting of the proteins, probably due to
pseudouridine which has been substituted into the “vaccines”, this is not caused by the SARS CoV-
2 infection itself. The authors state the:‘ error prone” code is a safety concern with a “huge
potential to be harmful” and that “it is essential that these therapeutics are designed to be
free from unintended side-effects.” There has been a failure by our regulatory bodies to research
these potential problems, the TGA was specifically asked about the effects of pseudouridine and this
aspect in a particular in a FOI request in February 2022.3 The response that the research documents:
“do not exist” show they did not consider and/or do not know the answer to the questions asked.
Nor did any other regulatory agency in the world. The altered immune response described in the
paper is added to the growing list of Adverse Events.
Research is available showing that products in the vaccines is deleterious effects to human health:
     a)     Spike Protein is toxic4 5 6 7 891e,c

     c) RNA enters the nucleus of the cell11 12 clearly shown in the TGANonclinical Evaluation

     d) The Vaccines are considered a gene technology by the FDA, Moderna14 p70, the American
         Society of Gene and Cell Therapy,15 the Australian Governments own website describes the
        process used in mRNA vaccines as gene technology.16
Even prior to Australia’s rollout of the “vaccine” the data from Pfizer was clearly showing an
enormous level of harm.1718  If anyone looked at the data published in the NEJM1819 they would have
                            19
noted that the data from Moderna and Pfizer showed no clear evidence of efficacy and certainly did

not show it was a safe product, especially when the supplementary data is studied. Information was
purportedly taken from sources who are known to have a high level of corruption and conflicts of
interest (COI). Pharma have been repeatedly convicted of criminal charges20 21 22 when they have
repeatedly mislead government, doctors and the regulatory agencies and the general public and been
guilty of fraud. “Companies can control information about their products by selectively
publishing or suppressing data..financial interests have contributed to patient harm...”23
Examples of corruption and COI include:
    1.       Regulatory and advisory bodies24 25 26 27
    2.       Medical Associations and Universities including Medical education28 29 30
    3. Experts31 who are frequently wrong32 “Science is being suppressed for political and
        financial gain. Covid-19 has unleashed state corruption on a grand scale, and
        it is harmful to public health. Politicians and industry are responsible for this
        opportunistic embezzlement. So too are scientists and health experts. The
        pandemic has revealed how the medical-political complex can be manipulated
        in an emergency”.33 (emphasis added)
    4. Medical and Science Journals are “broken”.34 “It is simply no longer possible to believe
        much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment (sic) of
        trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines...Medical journals: are
        “primarily a marketing machine”. Dr                 editor in chief of the NEJM for over a
        decade, accuses “industry of co-opting “every institution that might stand in its way.”35
    5.       Researchers, scientists and physicians.36 37 38 39
The federal government also heavily conflicted40 41 42 showed by its policies and in-actions in the
face of state mandates and policies, its main interest is not the protection and safety of the people.
B) In the rush to rely on vaccination, natural immunity was officially “forgotten”. The reliance on
vaccine induced immunity is problematic and the science particularly behind vaccinating young
people and children was never there.43 44 evidence shows natural immunity is at least as effective as

vaccine immunity.45 46 47 There are 160+ studies showing the superiority of naturally acquired
immunity in Covid-19.48 There are a great many more repeat infections among vaccinated
individuals. A NEJM piece which cites 16 studies shows that children who had Covid and were
subsequently vaccinated, were much more likely to get reinfected than their peers who also had
Covid, and were NOT vaccinated. In fact their study showed that the immunity gained from
vaccination waned within 20 weeks and the vaccinated children were left with no immunity.49
C) It was known early on that the main comorbidities for Covid-19 are metabolic diseases.50 51If the
federal government wished to help the people of Australia it was the perfect opportunity to educate
the people about healthy diets and lifestyles.52 53 54 Even prior to Covid -19, we are faced with the
reality that metabolic diseases cause more deaths than Covid. The leading causes of death are
shown to be largely caused by metabolic disease:55 Cancer,56 Diabetes57 and Cardiovascular
disease.58 Cancer causes nearly 10 million deaths globally.59 Diabetes kills 1.5 million people a year
globally.60 Cardiovascular disease kills 17.9 million people a year globally.61
“Big Food” like “Big Pharma” spend inordinate amounts of money lobbying governments,
physicians62 and contributing to organisations63 that should be promoting health, but become
compromised by the donations and influence of these organisation,.64 65 Big food have tried to tell
us in their marketing documents, they call “research” that the obesity crisis is nothing more than a
lack of exercise, while independent research shows diet modification is more effective than
exercise.66 67 etc Diabetes type 2 and other metabolic diseases are reversible with the implementation
of a low carb diet.68 69 70
People are increasingly aware of the corruption of international and national health organisations
that in fact “corruption is embedded in health systems.”71 Not enough room to discuss the
harms of censorship, shutting down discussion by medical professionals and scientists on treatment
options and successes has caused untold harms to the worlds population. There is never one source
of truth in medicine and science. The excess deaths needs desperately to be investigated rather than
using the assumption without evidence that it cannot be the “vaccines” and is due to other issues
like lockdowns and delayed medical treatment and checkups. While these things probably had an
impact but we do not have evidence to know for sure. The response was not based on evidence.
