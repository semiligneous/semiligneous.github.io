Covid Inquiry Submission 2023

I would like to address the response to the Covid event.

I believe fear was used to coerce the public into receiving not one but multiple
injections of a vaccine that was very new and still in trial stages.

This is risky especially when administered to children, the elderly, the frail and
pregnant women.

The medical community that raised concerns after seeing a rises in adverse
reactions and events within their own practices were silenced, removed from their
position and/or their concerns were not taken seriously.

One such Doctor                             This Dr also obtained documents from TGA
after filing for FOI request (FOI 3727), found that the deaths relating to the vaccine
that the TGA reported was no true according to the documents she had been
provided. More deaths were not made public.

Concerns that were raised by the medical community would have been valuable to
the public especially those with children had it been allowed to be part of the
discussion. When all the information is made available people are then able to
make informed decisions and in this case regarding their own bodies and health.

The handling of information and the dishonesty that seem to abound during this time
undermines the public's liberty.
