I am a church pastor.

I talk with a lot of people all around Australia. I'm so appreciating the opportunity to speak into this enquiry.
My points below are in my view, mainstream. I would say that maybe 8 out 10 people that I connect with
hold similar views.

What was clearly wrong and should never be repeated.

    •       Release of a 'vaccine' that was, for all practical purposes untested.
    •   A blind trust in the assurances of vaccine-producing companies and those institutions on their
        payroll eg some Universities and research facilities.
    •   A stubborn refusal to listen to leading virologists and immunologists around the world about the
        dangers and misuses of Mrna technologies.
    •   The politicising of known effective treatments to the extent that they were not taken advantage of
        and those using them were persecuted and vilified. This cost many lives. Highly qualified medical
        practitioners were deregistered and shamed. This was a disgusting abuse and overreach of
        government power.
    •   Vaccine mandates. These violate the basic human right to make our own medical choices and have
        sovereignty over our own bodies. No government 'owns' us.
    •       Coercion and financial blackmail (get it or get sacked) to get the vaccine.
    •       A corresponding complete lack of informed consent.
    •   The hatred and bile spread on national media outlets by government spokesmen and women
        towards anyone who disagreed with much of the government response to Covid 19.
    •   A stubborn refusal (which continues to this day) to record, research, monitor and respond to the
        hundreds of thousands of vaccine injuries and deaths. The side effects of the Mrna vaccines are
        well-known and people continue to drop like flies from them. Yet government continues to promote
        them as if they are the answer. How can this be justified?
    •       Denial and cover-ups of the injuries and deaths. (Continuing to this day)
    •       The dictatorial, cruel and inhumane lockouts
                People from family funerals
                Family from dying family members and elderly family members in nursing homes
                People from medical care. People died!
                Border closures separating families, and even disallowing people to return to their homes!
                Healthy workers from their place of employment
               Quarantining perfectly healthy people on a large scale! (Aren't quarantines for the sick?)
