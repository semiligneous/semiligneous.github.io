COVID-19 Response Inquiry:                   (15/12/2023)

I write as an Australian citizen, profoundly concerned about aspects of the response of the
Commonwealth Government to the COVID-19 pandemic and its (ongoing) impact on the democratic
rights and freedoms of all Australians.

The purpose of the Inquiry is to improve response measures in the event of future pandemics, and
this can only be achieved by acknowledging failures, identifying conflicts of interest and upholding
the principles of transparency and accountability.

Key points of concern are summarised below, as broadly aligned to the Inquiry Terms of Reference:

    •   Scope/Terms of Reference of the Inquiry
           o The scope/terms of reference of the inquiry are grossly inadequate, by:
                 ■ Excluding all state and territory government decisions and unilateral actions
                     (including lockdowns, border closures, school closures, mask mandates,
                     vaccine mandates, quarantine and check-in rules).
                 ■ Omitting an explicit focus on the impact of Australia's COVID response on
                     human rights, including the right to freedom of movement; right to freedom
                     of thought, conscience and religion; the right to freedom of opinion and
                     expression (this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference
                     and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media
                     and regardless of frontiers); the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and
                     association; the right to work; the right to education (and for parents to have
                     a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their
                     children (https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-
                     rights); as well as the right to 'Informed consent' as outlined in the
                     Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights.
                 ■ Providing a submission period of one week, without advance notice.
                 ■ The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have previously expressed
                     support for certain pandemic measures, which undermines the objectivity
                     and impartiality of the Inquiry.
           o These omissions render the Inquiry inherently selective and superficial.

    •   A comprehensive, objective Inquiry encapsulating the response of all levels of government is
        required to adequately evaluate the government's response and recommend meaningful
        changes.



    •       Governance
            o The COVID-19 pandemic saw unprecedented measures taken through overreach of
               government authority, suspending civil liberties and freedoms under the guise of
               public health.
                   ■ This consolidation of power - such as through Prime Minister Scott Morrison
                       secretly acquiring 5 ministry appointments
                       (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-17/scott-morrison-secret-ministry-
                       appointments-who-knew-timeline/101337414 ;; and lack of transparency -
                       such as seeking to keep secret minutes of the National Cabinet Meetings
                    (https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/02/a-sore-loser-
                    scott-morrison-attacked-over-move-to-keep-national-cabinet-deliberations-
                    secret), are antithetical to our core democratic principles.
       o   Our democratic values include tolerance of differences and opposing ideas; freedom
           of speech, association, movement and freedom of belief; as well as respect for
           individuals and their right to make their own choices
           (https://www.aph.gov.au/About Parliament/House of Representatives/About the
           House News/News/Parliament Explained Democracy)
                ■ However, the government actively sought to censor views on social media
                    that did not align with Government narrative
                    (https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/feb/17/australias-
                    department-of-home-affairs-made-most-requests-for-covid-misinformation-
                    takedowns), setting a dangerous precedent for silencing dissenting views and
                    public debate
       o   The federal government failed to introduce anti-discrimination legislation to prevent
           discrimination against the unvaccinated [such as would have been achieved through
           the Vaccination Status (Prevention of Discrimination) Bill 2022 and the Fair Work
           Amendment (Prohibiting COVID-19 Vaccine Discrimination) Bill 2023], including to
           protect those who may have been fired for not receiving an injection, or denied
           access to medical services, or entry in to businesses and essential services. This
           enabled coerced vaccination whilst asserting it was not 'mandated'. Outsourcing this
           decision to states and businesses rubber stamps institutional discrimination.
•   Measures must be taken to uphold transparency, accountability, freedom of speech and
    informed consent in future pandemics, whilst also protecting against all forms of
    discrimination.


•       Key health response measures
       o   The health response of the Government was singular, coercive and ineffective,
           hinging on provisionally-approved, experimental gene therapy 'vaccines'.
                ■ With in excess $18 billion dollars spent on COVID-19 vaccines and
                   treatments (https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/about-
                   rollout/vaccine-agreements), with less than a quarter of purchased COVID-
                   19 vaccines having been utilised (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-07-
                   18/australia-covid-vaccine-surplus-options/101237430), this was a gross
                   misuse of taxpayer monies.
              ■    These vaccines were unanimously promoted by the Australian Government
                   as 'safe and effective' ("Getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to protect
                   yourself and your community from getting very sick or dying from COVID-19"
                   - https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-04/covid-19-
                   vaccination-covid-19-vaccines-common-questions.pdf). However, they were
                   only provisionally-approved, with extremely limited testing, indeed, not
                   having been tested for effectiveness at preventing transmission:
                   https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/human-body/pfizer-did-not-
                   know-whether-covid-vaccine-stopped-transmission-before-rollout-executive-
                   admits/news-story/f307f28f794el73ac017a62784fec414 ).
                ■ Furthermore, significant side effects are associated with these vaccines. This
                   has revealed the gross inadequacies in both the (voluntary) Adverse Event
                   Reporting system (https://phillipaltman.substack.com/p/australias-adverse-
                   drug-event-reporting as well as with regard to the treatment of the
                    vaccine-injured through the narrow Federal Scheme
                    (https://umbrellanews.com.au/featured/2023/06/government-stalls-on-
                    compo-for-covid-vaccine-injuries/ ).
                ■   Australia's excess death rate has soared by more than 10 percent since
                    COVID-19 vaccine distribution in 2021, which cannot be explained by COVID,
                    as demonstrated in the Australian Medical Professionals Association's
                    publication 'Too Many Dead.' An inquiry must be undertaken in relation to
                    excess deaths in Australia, however, this has not been supported to date
                    ( ttps://www.flownews24.com.au/post/inquiry-needed-into-excess-deaths-
                    in-australia-antic)
                ■   This singular focus on vaccination came at the omission of a public health
                    campaign to address COVID-19 risk factors, such as obesity and Vitamin D
                    insufficiency, as well as less expensive, less dangerous treatments, such as
                    Ivermectin (which, instead, was suppressed by the Therapeutic Goods
                    Administration - https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/new-
                    restrictions-prescribing-ivermectin-covid-19 )
                ■   Furthermore, recent agreements between Australian and state governments
                    and global vaccine developers to produce on-shore respiratory mRNA
                    vaccines for potential future pandemics raises significant questions of
                    conflict of interest
                    (https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/taylor/media-
                    releases/mrna-vaccines-be-made-australia
                ■   The communication strategy undertaken by the Commonwealth government
                    was categorised by an unwarranted use of fear, oversimplification of public
                    health messaging and an 'othering' - or outright silencing - of dissenting
                    voices.

•   I strongly advocate repealling the 2017 legislation creating Provisional Registration and insist
    on proper testing for novel drugs.
•   I implore you to immediately halt the distribution of gene-vaccine products pending
    independent testing.
•        An inquiry must be undertaken in relation to excess deaths in Australia
•   These public/private partnerships should not be allowed to direct policy or the
    'recommended' medical interventions.




•       Support for industry and business / Financial supports/ Community supports
        o The failure of the Federal Government to support businesses and schools to remain
           open, should they so choose, whilst rolling out a suite of government grants,
           payments and stimulus that disincentivised returning to work, is a further step
           towards Australia becoming a 'nanny state', with crippling effects on the Australian
           economy, as evidenced by the current inflation-driven cost of living crisis. It was not,
           in fact, COVID-19, but the Government's response to it, that "caused significant
           disruption to historic patterns of growth in the Australian economy"
           (https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/economic-gains-and-losses-over-covid-19-
           pandemic).
