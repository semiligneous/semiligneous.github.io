Submission for the Royal Commission into the Australian Covid response.

I am Susan Galea residing in                                   thank you for your consideration.

I have 3 areas of concern:-

    1) Doctors did not need to be gagged. They are the connection of people to health services and
       they are professional. No doctor should have been persecuted for their input, they are there
       to care for their patients. Patients can choose their doctor and can choose whether to follow
       their advice.
    2) Health response was not holistic, it was one size fits all. More attention should have been
       paid to health guidelines and keeping yourself healthy, enhancing your immune system and
       preventative factors to enable people to look after themselves. Obesity increases health risk
       and so help should begiven to tackling that as well. Already legally obtainable substances
       should have still been available and not outlawed. Exemptions should have been readily
       granted eg for masks and for injections as some people would have had their own methods
       to avoid or minimise infection.
    3) Instead of locking down populations which did not affect the final outcome as shown by
       comparing to countries that did not lock down alternatives should have been encouraged. In
       other words at risk people could have been isolated or kept apart, eg opening hours of
       supermarkets just for those who thought they were more at risk, that occurred in the UK.
       The rest of society could have functioned as normal. No enforced lockdowns it should have
       been voluntary depending on risk.
