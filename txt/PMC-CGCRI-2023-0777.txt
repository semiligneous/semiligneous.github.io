COVID-19 Response Inquiry - SUBMISSION

12/12/2023
My name is Renae Schmidt, I represent myself, my husband, as well as my 15- and 17-year-old sons.
My husband was forced to get the covid jab to keep his job. He sacrificed himself so that I didn’t need to. 12 months down
the track the company reneged the mandate. He was forced to get the jab, when he didn’t want it, didn’t need it and it
could have been left to his choice, as it would not have affected anyone else. We stay home when we are sick. I lost 3
months pay, $30,000. The mandate was taken away from my job as they then had and still have severe shortages, that
have now been compacted by the domino effect. Obviously enough workers in my job decided no. In my home town, I
know of plenty who decided that they did not need it and were forced to take leave with or without pay. This was unjustified
as at no stage were we provided with a risk assessment for if we got a covid infection, we were never provided with
answers to basic questions, just told to look at the Health department sites. I was given responses, but never answers by
the health departments either. This in turn left the rest of the workforce to pick up the pieces as we could not be replaced.
This caused an unnecessary burden on the workforce, increasing the rate of people leaving the profession.
My son was refused educational experiences because he did not need the jab, and my other son missed out on sporting
opportunities, which impacts on his life goals.
None of my family were at risk, we had every reason to decline the jab, as we did not need it. Truth being, none of us
were affected by Covid. It was our human right to take that risk. My Husband ended up being sicker than all of us combined,
he was sick for a week after the second jab, and was really sick compared to us when he got Covid. To put into perspective,
about not being at risk, none of my 3 unjabbed grandparents in their 90’s are dead from covid. Obviously, my family health
is fine.


Governance including the role of the Commonwealth Government, responsibilities of state and territory governments,
national governance mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination Mechanism and the Australian
Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory bodies supporting responses to COVID-19.____________________
The governance was disgusting throughout the pandemic. The fact that the Commonwealth government was saying one
thing and then the state/territory governments then made up their own rules that all contradicted each other, meant that it
was just ridiculous. We the people were unable to believe anything that was said by the governments as they were not
functioning as one, with one message, that explained anything. The Prime Minister continuously lied saying the vaccines
were voluntary, yet made them compulsory by providing the tools for states to enforce them. Making a vaccine passport
available, so that unjabbed (I cannot call a drug, that does not prevent anything, a vaccine) were locked out of society
was not a way to create trust in the government or the vaccine. For the commonwealth government to force vaccinations
on the population and publicly lie about it completely undermined any good the government could ever have done.
None of the Health advisory bodies provided consistent advice that made sense. To say it is ok to go to the football, but
not a protest, but a BLM protest was ok, was illogical. To have the government use the mainstream media for fear
mongering without providing the whole picture just created even more mistrust. They did not share the real facts, but parts
of facts, manipulated data and graphs to make it look worse that it was, so it was not believable.
The Commonwealth government should have the final say in how the Australian people were treated. To allow states to
lock people up, close borders, prevent families from seeing each other and having different rules, showed that we are not
one country, we should not even bother paying taxes to this country, and just stick to the states. This country has no
central government as shown by the way they could not make one rule for the country to follow.


Key health response measures (for example across COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments, key medical supplies such
as personal protective equipment, quarantine facilities, and public health messaging)._____________________________
This was all fear mongering. From the start, it was clear that Healthy working aged people, especially under 30 year olds
were never at risk. To force these people to take a Drug (vaccine that doesn’t work) that was still in the early stages of
development makes no logical sense. There was and still is no long term safety data. It is clearly not necessary for healthy
people to risk taking a drug they don’t need to protect them from something that is not even dangerous for them.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9025C' 3/ shows that Covid 19 infections did not increase the risk for
Myocarditis or pericarditis. Yet many health messages from the government said that covid infections would cause this at
a higher rate than normal, so the vaccine would protect them, even though there was clear evidence that the vaccine itself
created a higher risk. Why risk a healthy population with a vaccine that they never needed.
Masks were said to be good, then they were bad, then they were good, too many mixed messaging. Masks were never
designed to stop viruses. They are PPE, personal protective equipment. Therefore it should be a choice whether someone
wishes to wear one or not. Forcing healthy people to wear mask is not healthy. Forcing young children to wear masks
inhibits healthy developmental outcomes. Children learn to speak and communicate through facial cues and imitation.
There is already evidence emerging that this has created developmental delays in children.
When a health worker is denied an exemption, even though their 2 surgeons provided one, (because they were getting
surgery), and the health worker is told that they need one from their doctor, you know the health messages are lies. When
APRHA and the CHO has sent letters to doctors specifying that they can’t provide exemptions, there is no possibility for
informed consent. There is lost trust in the health department.


Broader health supports for people impacted by COVID-19 and/or lockdowns (for example mental health and suicide
prevention supports, and access to screening and other preventive health measures)._____________________________
This whole plandemic just highlighted how terrible our whole health system is. The fact that we have a doctor and
healthcare service workers shortage became abundantly clear, when the system couldn’t keep up with more sick people.
The hospitals did not even have that many people in them, but they could not cope. Covid is not even a massive thing
now, and the system still struggles. It is about time, all health care workers, doctors included were educated in this country
for free. Why should it be so difficult and expensive to be a doctor, when we need them. Seriously, have high standards,
but get rid of the fees. Having too many doctors would alleviate and reduce burnout.
It was clear from the start, that the healthier you were, the less likely you were to have issues from Covid. The majority of
deaths and critical illnesses were in people who already had multiple comorbidities’. It is beyond a joke to lock up healthy
people to protect the few that are sick. Those people that are already sick or have health issues, are and always were
responsible for looking after themselves.
 It is common knowledge also that being outdoors and getting fresh air is important for mental health, which in turn helps
prevent suicide. Locking people up in their homes and closing playgrounds, parks and beaches, goes against human
freedoms and is harmful for health. It became clear that the government was not looking after the people, but working out
how to control them. Lock downs were ineffective and never stopped or slowed the spread.
People couldn’t go and see a doctor then, many still can’t. Doctors were too scared to see someone if they had a cough,
even if it clearly wasn’t covid. Where is the logic to sit unvaccinated babies outside with the unvaccinated adults, when
the parents of the babies were fully vaccinated. Supposedly the unvaccinated babies (who couldn’t even get a vaccine)
were too dangerous to sit with vaccinated people, yet it was ok to risk their lives with unvaccinated adults. Just makes a
mockery of the whole situation. Unvaccinated people were never a risk to vaccinated people, unless the vaccine didn’t
work in the first place???


International policies to support Australians at home and abroad (including with regard to international border closures,
and securing vaccine supply deals with international partners for domestic use in Australia).
At the start, it was clearly going to be a health issue. The government had every chance to prewarn all overseas
Australians to return home. They could have been given a 2-3 week deadline to return so that the borders could be closed.
Once returned, all returnees could have isolated/quarantined for 2-3 weeks. It was clear early on that the 2 week
quarantine was pointless, as many spread it after that. After 3 weeks, if someone is not sick, they are not likely to be sick.
Quarantine would have been easy, most people would have done this if it was clearly stated with reasoning behind it. In
the end though, none of it was going to stop the spread, it just delayed it. Therefore locking citizens out of their own
country is inhumane and should not have been done. People lost life savings, having to stay in a country where they were
not citizens and could not have a proper life.
No vaccine should be provided with indemnity. If they are provided with indemnity, then obviously they don’t trust their
own product enough to be safe and effective. The fact that they were provided indemnity at the onset, was enough to
convince many that it was not safe.
Acquiring the number of vaccines that the government procured was a joke. To purchase enough to inject 10 or more into
every Australian, when the majority were never at risk, is and has been a huge waste of our tax payer’s money, let alone
completely greedy. If it was so important to inject every human on the planet, why did the countries with lots of money,
not share with the countries who didn’t have much? Obviously herd immunity was a myth that the government lied about.
When we donated millions to the research, did we not own a share in the production of the vaccine in the first place?


Support for industry and businesses (for example responding to supply chain and transport issues, addressing labour
shortages, and support for specific industries)._____________________________________________________________
Forcing people out of work through mandates, just created labour shortages and the domino effect created harder work
for the ones left, meaning they were more stressed out and unhealthy, more susceptible to disease.


Financial support for individuals (including income support payments).
Businesses were forced to close, people were forced to lose their jobs, and for what? It changed nothing, the virus spread
anyway. Taxpayer money was given to people who never had jobs in the first place. Why not have just given a tax break
to the people that work and earn their money. None of it was logical. The way the government threw money away, was
disgusting. No one was impressed with career dole bludgers getting extra money for nothing.


Community supports (across early childhood education and care, higher education, housing and homelessness
measures, family and domestic violence measures in areas of Commonwealth Government responsibility).
The fact that the government encouraged families to split up and treat each other disgustingly through abuse, based
around personal decisions, was abhorrent. Government needs to keep their opinions to themselves if they are negative.
They abused the people who rightfully chose not to get a vaccine. They segregated them, they discriminated against them
and they encouraged people to basically divorce them. Many families were destroyed by this disgusting unAustralian
behaviour. To call people names, is to not change their minds. The government encouraged violence towards people who
disagreed with mandates, as seen in evidence by the police shooting at protesters and bashing people for walking in
parks. There can be no denying this happened as there is ample footage of it all over the internet. To censor it now, would
be to prove it is correct. The government is all about dividing the population and pitting them against each other, hence
they support and encourage domestic violence. The government continued to push people into homelessness, by forcing
them out of jobs, making them lose their businesses and did nothing to help them. When you mandate people out of jobs,
you create more homelessness.


Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular populations (including across genders, age
groups, socio-economic status, geographic location, people with disability, First Nations peoples and communities and
people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities)._________________________________________________
How about start working on the general health of this population in the first place, so next pandemic our healthy population
won’t be so vulnerable. The fact that many children in this country do not play sport in any way, because it is either too
expensive, or parents are too lazy to take them is a huge let down to the health of the people. Start investing in actual
education and sporting programs that target ages 10-18, so that all of the children in this age group play more varieties of
sport, all year round. This would improve the overall physical, mental and social health of the population, and make them
less susceptible to diseases. Improving all health outcomes would be a win for all groups.



I demand a Royal Covid Commission, notjusta Royal Inquiry.
I believe it is reprehensible that Actions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments are not being investigated
as they are the main ones that have affected the population in a negative way.
Also why are the media not being investigated for promoting lies. To push the vaccines onto children, it was stated that
they should get them to protect the grandparents. There was never any evidence, that the vaccines would stop
transmission, yet that was how they were promoted. Chidren were never at risk, yes some have died,|
                                                                                                | So, there was never any
reason to scare children or parents and force them to get a jab they didn’t need. There was no benefit to them.

I believe no employer should ever have the right to discriminate against any employee based on any vaccination status.
Health details are meant to be private and only disclosed by choice. No one should have been forced to disclose their
vaccination status. This is no different to the flu vaccine and yes health workers are required to have this, but it still defies
belief, that healthy people are forced to get it.

No one should have, or should ever lose jobs, opportunities, or education based on their vaccine status.
Protecting oneself should always be a choice.
