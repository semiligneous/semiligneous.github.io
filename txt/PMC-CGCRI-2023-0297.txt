To the COVID-19 Response Inquiry Taskforce,

I am an individual in Melbourne with^^^^^^^^who experienced lockdown and after
lockdown has had covid twice. I've had ongoing health issues after having covid.

My feedback is around the government response after lockdown. The intense restriction we
experienced has been pulled back significantly. As someone who has                   this is
distressing. It's not enough to only have access to one covid vaccination a year when you're
not immune-compromised. Also, the public health messaging is now about forgetting covid
exists, rather than some encouragement to wear masks when you can't physically distance
yourself.

While it's great that the community is getting back to its pre-lockdown activities, covid is
rampant and can still be harmful for many people, it would be great to have more support
for chronically ill people in the form of:

   -       More frequent boosters
   -       More encouragement to wear masks.
