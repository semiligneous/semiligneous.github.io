     Commonwealth Government COVID-19 Response Inquiry
     Thursday, 14 December 2023           11:03 AM




     This is my own personal experience, I am a mum, wife who experienced a massive amount of stress that would not have happened were it not for the Covid 19 Response. These
     emotions were Fear, ostracization, loss of job for a time, relationships ruined and challenged with Loved ones. Lost relationships never to be repaired, with people spurred on by the
     permissions they felt granted to them to treat others like sub human through the divisive tactics used to divide and shame people into vaccinated and unvaccinated. I felt like I was
     living in a waking nightmare. I am still have deep seated emotions form this period of time, I feel I am containing a lot of anger, and I want a full enquiry into the COVID 19 response, so
     that this response never happens again.

  Specific areas of review are below and may included, but not limited to:
• The role of the Commonwealth Government, responsibilities of state and territory governments, national governance mechanisms (such as National Cabinet, the National Coordination
  Mechanism and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory bodies supporting responses to COVID-19, systems to more effectively anticipate, adapt and respond to
  pandemics in areas of Commonwealth Government responsibility, wide-ranging impacts of COVID-19 across portfolios and the community.
    • The Emergency Response was worse than the pandemic, and caused a lot of mental harm and unnecessary fear, and was complete o\erreach. Please review the resources, articles and opinions
       PANDA.org website fRANDA: Independent Insights to Empower Societies (pandata.org) for their articles on this subject matter, and take into consideration their stance and views on this matter, they
       have actually been correct and impart valuable information which we should take heed of on many aspects of the pandemic.
    • National Coordination Mechanism and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee) and advisory bodies supporting responses to COVID-19.-The way that legislation and
       temporaty facilities were used to overpowering effect to wipe away citizens rights was eye watering.
• Advisory bodies supporting responses to COVID-19. - THIS WAS NOT TRANSPARENT and had all the hallmark of capture and secretiveness.
    • Recommendations-Actively include other advisory bodies and public groups who offer an alternate message or view, that is backed up by experience and track records of these professionals, e.g.
       https://pandata.org/
    • Observations: I feel many governments world wide and including in Australia were hoodwinked or propagandised by the "Advisory Bodies" theywere engaged with or were complicit in the responses during the
       Covid 19 pandemic with Media hijacking and censorship to fit a one size fits all response, due to regulatory captured, industry captur^j^weakhvbenefactors driving the outcome of the response. It truly felt like a
       hidden unseen agenda was pre-planned, and what played out was like a text book response to a table top exercise that took place vi^^^^^l^^nd then conveniently had ready the ticker of death stats count
          and covid spread, ramping up the fear level to maximum                                                                        & the Covid 19 Heat map: https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/tabletop-

          •          The Censorship Industrial Complex I Paul Thacker- PANDA (pandata.org) - 28:51min (video on Rumble).
          •Ignoring the Hypocratic Oath to patients, it was like our doctors were replaced with one size fits all policy, health is nuanced as so is each person's reaction to virus and pathogens, a lot of these basic fundamentals
          were ignored.
       • Advisory bodies need to LISTEN to the information from dissenting voices and criticism, not firing doctors for not having a vaccine and using draconian bullying methods to silence these voices... hear them out
          instead, and offer valid objections if you choose not to.
       • There were many doctors on the frontline who had real experience and were ignored or derided, now a lot of these voices and articles written at the time are censored (or blatantly ignored, either by ego or what
          ever reasons, but none seem valid to me), all that happens is they are forced to use other avenues to be heard, and over time are proved to be correct, no matter how much they get bullied, they stand up again, and
          again, e.g. Britain hyping up alarm about Omicron unnecessarily: South African doctor - The Week; KZN doctor found guilty for using unscientific Covid-19 treatments (iol.co.za) - Everything this doctor found out was
          accurate, well studied, and he was completely capable, however because he dared to actually "practice medicine treatment", he was found guilty on some spurious reasons (considering it was a pandemic, and he
          wasn't using any medicines that were not unknown and are available for "off label use", stupidity that was heaped on Ivermectin use. In the end who declared the VACCINE and some other therapeutics as the ONLY
           WAY, seemed very narrow minded to ignore effective medicines that existed and readily available. Vaccine companies should be held accountable to the same standards as this doctor was, since the vaccine was
          neither "SAFE or EFFECTIVE", a statement that sends shivers through me as well as "STAY SAFE", "LOCKDOWN", I could go on. I jollowed this doctors story he from the beginning, he harmed no one!!!!! He was being
          true to his hypocratic Oath, whilst he is not here in Australia he is an example of other doctors here who were subject to the same bullying tactics, instead of engaging and learning from them they seemed to be
          considered adversaries. Seems lessons from the past are hard to learn e. g. The man who discovered that handwashing saves lives | OpenMind (bbvaopenmind.com). / honestlyfeel as though the last fe w years
          were contrived to meet an outcome of mass control the nation and see how much citizens could be pushed, and all tools were utilized including mass hypnosis, NLP, fear the list goes on. The UK even had the 77th
          brigade to control what was happening online, It has left me broken and disillusioned lacking in trust.
•    Key health response: measures:
•    COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments, COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments, key medical supplies E.G. Personal protective equipment, quarantine facilities
       • TESTING KITS = none of this up your nose nonsese, saliva tests are the way to go. Send these in the post, have reguest on demand line to fave tests sent out, in the post. These tests very fast become a money making
         scam. Overpriced. Testing centres locations were stressful invasive, never open when you went, waste of fuel, with modern tedi and phones we could have just called into a number with our test (received in post or
          local delivery point) and for data collection on voluntary basis one could all in with the name, serial number date, results...e.g. the UK had the ZOE app where results were collated, symptoms tracked etc, a lot was
          learned.
          Never push a one size fits all vaccine as a treatment ever again, this was harmful to so many, and did not work. Never ban or discredit off label treatments and medicines that can be used in the arsenal their best of
         their effects, what is already tested and proven cannot be as harmful, and often more economical. In the hype of preventingcertain treatments only in favour to push a vaccine, lost opportunities to analyse data of
         treatments and conditions that favoured a good outcome. Eg. we learned that simple Vit D was useful. Getting out exercise insunshine and walking helped maintain social and general health, even during social
         distancing this could be maintained. We learned that Ivermectin is NOT just a horse medicine and can be used, no mattrer howmuch it was attempted to discredit.
         Stop the regulatory capture that existed in favour of a few treatments, and the discrediting of others that appeared driven tythe American CDCand their FDA. Many doctors were treating covid 19 early on when it
         was still in harmful form very successfully on patients with underlying health conditions, and the media set upon discrediting anyone that wasn't in the private circle of the TGA', and "advisory bodies", the end a
          lot of useful treatments and observations were ignored, and appeared t^ause fear in doctors to managthe respiratory distress and pneumonias that developed. Pfizer/Moderna Document Analysis - source: UK
         Situation Room: Pfizer/Moderna Document Analysis | UKColumn: What|                   (knew: The mRNA vaccines did not work.
              •      The ingredients, including lipid nanoparticles, in the mRNA injections bio-distributed throughout the body in a couple of days, accumulating in the liver, adrenals, spleen and ovaries,
                   and the FDA knew that the injections damaged the hearts of minors—and yet waited months to inform the Public.
                   "adverse events" reports that they were receiving and thatthe company anticipated receiving. 61 people in the trials died of strokes, and half of the stroke adverse events were within a couple of days after
                 I_____ H Five people in the trials died of liver damage—with, again, many of the liver damage adverse events sustained shortly after the injection. Neurological events, cardiac events, strokes, brain
                     haemorrhages, blood clots, lung clots and leg clots were occurring at massive scale.
                 •                   Headaches, joint pain, and muscle pain were rampant as adverse events, though these are not disclosed as routine side effect warnings by our agencies. From
                     <https://www.ukcolumn.org/series/uk-situation-room-pfizermoderna-document-analysis>
              "there was no adequate informed consent" - due misrepresentation and missing facts and data. The long list of paperwork that people had to sign prior to getting the vaccine screamed of an experimental trial,
              and I doubt most people signing even realised. People were taken advantage of an not supplied the necessary information requred or the data truthfully reported on at the time to make and informed decision,
              stop lying!!!!!!!!!!!!
    • personal protective equipment, quarantine facilities,
         1.         Quarantine was harmful and pointless - it separated people at their most important times, e.g. visiting dying relatives, the emotional scars will last a life time.
         2.         The quarantine facilities, were expensive for many people to afford, and many complained thatthe treatment was dismal for the cost, and the food was awful.
         3.         Quarantine isolation went on too long, and was very concerning to me. There seemed to be a completed lack of compassion.
         public health messaging: This in my opinion was a waking nightmare, draconian and frightening, what I witnessed and have personal first hand knowledge and stories from friends how this has effected them
         mentally and emotionally. Trust in democracy, respect for human rights was severely tarnished by the actions taken and imple mented examples below
    1.       Stop the fear mongering of COVID, start changing public health messaging from the wrongful, narrative of "Safe and Effective".
            1            . Be honest that most people will not even know they have the virus, and people develop other forms of resistance which are natures natural firewalls to spread, far better than a vaccine.
            2 . Stop giving "provisional approval', which in reality is 'back-door' access to pharmaceuticals via the TGA. Start with adopting a 'safe passage' procedure that is transparent, publicly accessible, and vigilant with
               reading assessment reports, studying trial information and long-term and shortterm safety data of vaccines (and medicines). NB. Thalidomide was rejected in the USA as an unsafe product in the 1960's.
           Pfizer’s Covid-19 Vaccine Clinical Trial Review: In this work, we review the reports provided by Pfizer to th^FD^orJh^nal's first interim analysis. The reports, demoratrate severe flaws in the
           procedure of approving Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine based on data from the vaccine's phase III clinical trial.:                      08 NOVEMBER 2022: Key Points
         •         Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine EUA (emergency use authorisation) was granted based on early results from an interim analysis from the vaccine’s phase III clinical trial
         • Deep examination of the results from this analysis suggest that the vaccine has an unfavourable profile with respect to severe events, with an increment of two to three cases of serious adverse
           events for every single case reduction of severe Covid-19
         • The samples used forthe analyses were selected post-hoc by unblinded investigators and did not follow protocol definitions, which implies possible biases, inflating both vaccinesafety and efficacy
           assessments                                                                                                                                                     "

    2.    Stop all conflicts of interest with funding and back door deals, between big Pharma, TGA and government. Do not rely on overseas report till they have been tried and tested rigorously and repeatable. No more legal
       indemnity to pharmaceutical companies, or relying on tax payers to fund their mistakes and lack of accountability of harm. Ch ange the conditions or refuse these commercial contracts that have bound up the
      commonwealth (including 'rogue'state/territory Governments). Ensure proper compensation channels for the jab-injured and families of people who die^ronnh^a^witlKranspareric^ri^om passion. Never
      again - state that unless your having difficulty breathing should you seek medical attention!!!!! What kind of health message is that. I never want to                                                     my TV social media
      again. We need critical thinking reporters who understand medical information in a critical way, honestly with balanced reporting. The only good thing to come out of the Pandemic - is that people now, when they feel
      sick, don't feel like they have muscle through and go to work under the weather, with medicine to mask symptoms,
       public health messaging - was very damaging......there are some key phrases that send the chills up my spine.
    3. LOCKDOWN, SAFE AND EFFECTIVE, VACCINATED V UNVACCINATED, ANTI VAXXERS, STAY SAFE, 1.5 METERS APART, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TRUST THE SCIENCE, and more.
    4. The way the messaging put people in two camps opposite each other, VACCINATED V UNVACCINATED, this literallbroke families and caused divorces. SHAME ON YOU!!! The families and suicides that were caused by
       this. I am aware                                                                                                                      Not to mention the severe anxiety that I personally felt throughout the entire reaction to
      the situation, my relationship is in tatters because of the brainwashing tactics you used on unsuspecting citizens. The way the media hyped up the numbers, we had watch the death toll tally live.... this has never
      happened in the past, I don't even feel like it could represent real data, I just don't see how this worked on a global scale, and the way it was set up so fast is extremely suspicious, how were countries realistically able to
      feed in the data so guickly from the get go. I did learn that the HOLY SEA was a country from that list. The way our local representatives in Queensland particularly held press briefings continuously were brainwashing,
      and designed to belittle and shame people constantly was frightening and draconian. The heavy handedness was absolutely ins ane. The messaging was everywhere and it was like a communist take over of services




                                                   CovidThoughts Page 1
  and messaging, the message was there is one solution the vaccine, you will take it or be ostracized from participating in life and we will make sure that we brainwash everyone to segregate you and treat you like a
  lepper, including your own family, they will taunt you, call you names for not buying into the single message we are dictating.
5. Confusing the meaning of efficacy, effectiveness and absolute risk reduction: The confusing noise to decipher medical analysis of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness and absolute risk reduction were all presented in a
  way that made people think they that vaccine would 1. stop transmission and thereby reduce spread and prevent the vaccinated person not getting sick. It failed miserably on both fronts. Efficacy /term used measure
  specific outcomes in ideal controlled environment eg. Aclinical study, that excludes anyone with a condition that may interfere with this outcome. Does the vaccine work. Does it do what its supposed to do.
  Effectiveness : does the vaccine work in the real world - a vaccine may be efficacious in a study, May work well in study but not the real world/community. Measures the rate of specific outcomes between
  unvaccinated and vaccinated in the general population

        1. Provisional approval - is not approval & confusing marketing approval as if its approval forthe drug.
Broader health supports for people impacted by COVID-19 and/or lockdowns (for example mental health and suicide prevention supports, and access to screening and other preventive
health measures): How about not repeating a lot of what went on that harmed people mentally. Most people would get over the illness, but the fear cuased people to panic, the messaging was clear the
probability of dying was low in the general population. Allow people to make their own health decisions, focus on targeted pratection. No more lock down. People that are immunocompromised who
needed targeted protection could have easily chosen how much they wanted to shelter in place. Or use PPE. People were made tcfeel like they were sickness spreaders.
International policies to support Australians at home and abroad (including with regard to international border closures, and securing vaccine supply deals with international partners for
domestic use in Australia).: Failed miserably in compassionate circumstances, people missing loved ones funerals, being with them in their dying moments.Border closures should never have happened,
e.g. in Queensland there is road that divides NSW and Queensland, and people use a hospital across the road, suddenly couldn't go to that hospital, the insanity of lack of common sense was astounding! Treating people
like they criminals for just existing and not want ting to buy into the one solution and barring people was incredibly harmful. All those QR codes, need to be scrapped. It was like data mining on a grand scale, and
incredibly offensive and divisive. Never assume that your entire population wants to take a novel vaccine. One that turns out didn't do what it said, was full of misinformation and misrepresented the data of how it
works, confused the public into thinking there was such a thing as a fast tracked solution on a "novel" vaccine, never before used on mass. The rush to try and give every human on the planet a vaccine was dangerous.
There should have been a lot more transparency. Other treatments were completely squashed like they didn't exist, there were many tools in the arsenal in treatments, but it seems everyone was convinced by the
propaganda machine that relevant treatments were just conspiracy and they only thing that happened was fake science, discredited papers (presented early as credible), the news cycle AstroTurfed the new cycle with
the messaging they wanted, which in turn was being controlled by the Government who wilfully censored, with the plausible deniability hiding behind the facade of it wasn't us that made the decisions it was up to
companies. I am still shocked at the amount of arrests, and innocent people standing up for their rights being manhandled by the police, it was disgusting behaviour.What happened to international human rights seems
like they were ignored, and the rule book rewritten. How dare a government dictate which jobs and businesses could continue.
Support for industry and businesses (for example responding to supply chain and transport issues, addressing labour shortages, and support for specific industries).: With regard to supply
chain, many people were forced into a situation to take a vaccine they did not want, even those that had already had covid, here was no need for vaccine. It seemed like all common sense left people.
In the end everyone got sick anyway and it wasn't even that bad for most, but what lingers is the fake drama and judgment that was created.
Financial support for individuals (including income support payments).: Whilst generous, it was too generous to a fault, many industries that were cutoff, like the mum and pappa home
businesses, they were severely affected, the grants were not accessible to them. I felt like the payments were too generous, there were many friends whose children had just finished school, suddenly earning a
lot more money than they coud have dreamed, not to mention that giving away that much money has and will affect the debt in the economy for generations. A better solution would have been to support business with
supplementing sick pay for staff off due to illness for COVID-19, which would have allowed industry to still continue, and less of a drain on tax payers, causing massive inflation. Allowed papa and mama business to claim
sick pay too during this period for home run business, a week of sick pay would have been much better and saved millions, and easier to manage.A lot of young people received income support that were still living with
parents and generally had a grand time on it.
Community supports (across early childhood education and care, higher education, housing and homelessness measures, family and domestic violence measures in areas of
Commonwealth Government responsibility): Domestic violence went up for many people who had to be locked up in tiny homes with no access to open spaces was traumatisirg.
  1. School closures, was a severe strain on parents and families. Lock downs and preventing movement of people. Open spaces and parks was safest, including beaches, and walks in nature, but it seems the
     government locked up society from the very things that increase ones health. Early child care, school and education, I feel should have continued with as little disruption or change, the wearing of masks for our
     kids was abusive (and now the science proves never prevented spread) and was harmful to development, and caused severe anxiety.
Mechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular populations (including across genders, age groups, socio-economic status, geographic location, people with
disability, First Nations peoples and communities and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities). The Inquiry will consider the findings of previous relevant inquiries
and reviews and identify knowledge gaps for further investigation. It will also consider the global experience and lessons learnt from other countries in order to improve response
measures in the event of future global pandemics. Findings of previous relevant inquiries and reviews

  Public Health: All public health recommendations should consider the impact on society's health, rather than focusing solely on a single disease. Public health should always consider both the benefits and harms of
  all measures and weigh short-term gains against long-term damage. Source: Public Health - PANDA (pandata.org): Question: Why were true and tested normal pandemic responses ignored? And evidence that had

  looks mild in isolation, and it looks very mild when compared to the first wave in New York City and elsewhere (e.g., Northern Italy). Testing data from the Diamond Princess arguably indicates that
  the severity may well have been even milder than generally believed, and clearly was of no danger to the non-elderly. The Diamond Princess event should have demonstrated to officials early on
  that this was not a particularly dangerous virus to the broad population, and that it certainly did not justify unprecedented draconian measures on a population-wide basis. Second, it is clear from the
  above discussion that something else beyond Covid or the spread of a respiratory virus was responsible fora significant majo rity of the “first-wave” excess deaths in NYC. Third, more likely causes
  of the unprecedented excess mortality in NYC need to be considered, including iatrogenic harms, psychological effects, neglect, panic stoked by constant media propaganda, ill-advised use of
  ventilators and sedatives, and policies relating to residents in care homes. If these were indeed the causes behind the excess in deaths in NYC in early 2020, a tragic proportion of the deaths were
  avoidable. "From <https://pandata.org/what-the-diamond-princess-tells-us-about-nyc-in-spring-2020/ >

 Vaccines : Mass public health measures always involve a trade-off between expected benefits and known potential risks of harms, which include both short-term and longterm or inter-generational damage (e.g.
 poverty). Separately, they must always uphold the basic human rights. These fundamental realities have been ignored in much of the public response to the Covid-19 event, including mass vaccination. Source:

ahead of the vaccine rollout in Australia. Alarmingly, these 3 publicly available reports showed safety concerns of a serious nature and identified risks such as anaphylaxis and "missing information', which, just because
there's not data, i.e.. Not tested yet. e.g. pregnant woman and breastfeeding. Immunocompromised, patients with comorbidities. No data on interaction with other vaccines, doesn't make it ok to mix or administer
with other vaccines for second doses. This is bad science, and muddy's safety signals in the data.

Children: Evidence already shows serious damage from the Covid response to the physical, mental and social well-being of children and young people, as well as their educational attainment and
future prospects. There was never a reason to disrupt the lives of children and young people and there is every reason to restore normality to this population. Policy-makers should take immediate
action to protect children and young people from further harm and injustice, now and in the future: From <https://pandata.org/topics/children/>
 Politics: The COVID-19 event has been politicised and weaponised to drive a series of political, social and economic agendas by local and global actors, the implications of which will affect society in a
 multitude of ways forthe foreseeable future. From <https://pandata.org/topics/politics/>
Propaganda & Censorship: Popaganda has been deployed across democracies on an unprecedented scale in order to gain compliance with the unorthodox and intrusive measures adopted during the
Covid-19 event. Just as important has been the suppression and censorship of those questioning the authorities - there is a case to be made thatthe most important part of any propaganda campaign
is the drive to ensure that certain voices, claims and arguments either never see the light of day or otherwise remain contai ned within “fringe” or “alternative” circles.: From

Lessons learnt, knowledge gaps for further investigation
•   There needs to be full enquiry and a royal commission into every aspect of the pandemic and the response to it. If this is not done Citizens cannot trust their governments and trust will be eroded. We want to see
 that our governments are not captured. I would like to see full transparency into vaccine acquisitions and any secret contrats with vaccine manufacturers. Why were local vaccine methods and manufacturers ignored.
 Put a stop to illegal vaccine mandates, vaccines should NEVER be mandated, and should be free from any form of coercion.
• Put a stop to "Official misinformation about vaccines blocking transmission!' - this is blatantly not true and never was! Tell the truth and report on Vaccine injuries! So that others stop feeling gaslit by having their
 symptoms ignored. Educate doctors on Vaccine injuries and how to recognise and report this easily. So that data can be correctly analysed. When does enough anecdotal injury start to look like a signal? When are
 systems created to listen to these people who end up on the fringes being labelled as "antivaxxers" very rude as most of them took a vaccine or witnessed or experience legitimately something going wrong directly
 after a vaccine. Be more transparent, allow people to self report through easier channels their symptoms, to be further investigated. Transparent Data at all times, can be anonymise, allow Al to assist with Reporting
 systems, there appeared to be a lack of Lack of transparency Doctors afraid to report/too busy/report! ng systems not easy - take away this fear by being honest. Doctors gaslighting patients by fobbing off their
 reported symptoms -                                                  is. Doctors themselves being gaslit thatthe reports are false, considering those that made it would have spent a lot of time to review, and put in at
 risk of losing licence if false. People not realising the symptoms they are experiencing are vaccine indued, or then reporting them to doctors but unsure if they are actually being reported.
     Personal story:had a reaction not once but twice to the same vaccines they were administering here, Pfizer Comirnaty; Text copied from                      message to me, note that she did not share this message
    with me till 14/12/2023, we had a fallout over our vaccine stance, and she was very much, the "Get vaccinated or you're an id iot/selfish/it's a no brainer group" so it was very troubling to read this message after

Consider the global experience & lessons learnt from other countries in order to improve response measures in the event of luture global pandemics.
 Review this resource for excellent information- Explore Our Range of Topics - PANDA (pandata.org)
South Africa: Has a lot of experience monitoring evolving pathogens and viruses. Lessons should be headed from this knowledge from the grassroots levels about the analysis they were making on the panedemic, e.g.
when omicron emerged, which was a GOOD thing evidence thatthe sting of the coronavirus, was moving fast from being harmful as is the case with a virus it will become less harmful because it wants to survive.
Sweden: Trusting their citizens to do the right thing, treated like adults, did better targeted protection to elderly citizens, were able to adapt and recognize quickly and admit where they adjusted when they realised
what wasn't working. Had the guts to stick to their tried true tested pandemic response, against a barrage of propaganda against them.
Canada & world wide: They had a similar response to pandemic as Australia and it was horrific to watch what they put citizens through, and to think that we had similar go on here, the video to the right is quite
accurate in the feelings and happenings that were felt equally here in Australia, see
