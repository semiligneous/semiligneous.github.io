Re Submission for Covid enquiry

I am a single parent to

Having lived through the Covid ‘pandemic’, I want to highlight the extreme trauma that
decisions made by both federal government, state government and health officials had on my
life and the life of loved ones.

The initial fearmongering that was transmitted 24/7 had such a detrimental effect on all our
health. My ^^^^[were afraid, my                     were afraid and it was left to me to try
and support them all. It was exhausting, and quite honestly a complete overreach.

The introduction of masks was madness as if this was a virus, masks would be of no benefit
apart from hindering breathing. Then came the MRNA vaccines - if anything segregated
society this did. To not allow access to loved ones unless you had the forced vaccine was a
medical weapon.

himself My I^^^Hhad just started^^^H and could not cope with online learning - he
had^Hyears of no education which still impacts him today. My                     became a
recluse as he was scared to go out of the house, and this is still an issue.

                  were a prisoner of their own home and having lived through the war
years, bad memories were stirred up.

I encourage there to be a full independent Royal Commission into the Covid Response as we
are still living undeMh^raconiaimegime today -              have an interview in their own
home scheduled for^^^^^^^^|with an Aged Care provider and they have been asked to
wear a mask????

I cannot understand why mandates are still in place and for those people that didn’t get
vaccinated, why are they not allowed to go back to work?? Healthcare, aged care, education,
police, firefighters are all struggling to get staff. The thousands of people that are off sick
after the vaccine, let alone the thousands of people that have died. This needs to be
investigated and not covered up.

We live in Australia which is meant to be the land of the free.
