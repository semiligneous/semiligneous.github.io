So to answer my own question, no we have no choice in what goes into our bodies, Yes
it's discrimination and yes I'm being forced to go against everything I believe in or
resign.

I want it noted that the only reason I have been forced to resign from my job is because
I refuse to have a vaccine that is not required by state or federal law.

It's really disappointing that you're imposing mandatory vaccination on your workers
even after the health department have dropped it for their departments.

Assuming from the letter I have received I have been given an ultimatum.
I will not be subjected to more illegal mandates, I have already jeopardized my health
having the previous 2 to keep my job I will not do it again.

I have returned my uniform and I will not be at work on the 4th of April.
