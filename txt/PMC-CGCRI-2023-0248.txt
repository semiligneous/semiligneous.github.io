Submission

The public health response to the pandemic many measures were instituted in the name of
medicine. There were unprecedented lockdowns, closing of businesses, separation of family
& friends, discrimination, economic reprisal for personal health decisions, not to mention
unprecedented police response to peaceful protests to name a few.

All in the name of health & medicine. Medical & nursing professionals were actively silenced
& told to follow the official narrative, directly conflicting with their own professional codes
of conduct.

There was unprecedented censorship of scientific debate, indeed we could not even openly
discuss alternative treatments to vaccinations without threats from our own certification
boards, regulatory boards & unions.

Throughout my forty plus years of nursing I have been taught to question - however, any
questions regarding covid or vaccinations we were labelled conspiracy theorists & we were
shut down.

All health professionals should be able to act in the best interests of their patients. Free from
government overreach & destruction of the patient confidentiality bond.

I want to see the inquiry:
    •       Establish & provide evidence the lockdowns worked.
    •       Establish & provide evidence the vaccines were safe.
    •       Establish & provide evidence the vaccines were effective.
    •       Establish & provide evidence medical censorship has been beneficial to public health.
    • Provide evidence that AHPRA's suspension of health professionals has been
        beneficial to public health.

However, more than anything I want the inquiry to demand a Royal Commission for a full
investigation into the whole pandemic debacle.
