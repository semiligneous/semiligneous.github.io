I am a small business owner and also the parent                                                               the
pandemic started. The pandemic naturally brought a lot of stress and fear.

The business support response by both the federal and state government in Victoria were the only thing that allowed
my business to survive the lockdowns in Melbourne. However, I do wholeheartedly support the lockdown response
as a means to keep stress off the health system and to allow us the chance to be vaccinated first.

Online schooling although difficult allowed my oldest child who^^^^^|and struggles within the ill equipped
education system to thrive. Working from home allowed my husband to connect with his family more than he had
been able to before and brought balance and flexibility to our home. All of this should be an ongoing option for
children and adults long term. Many children are anxious within the education system because of its numerous and
many downfalls and discriminatory practices. There should be learning from home options for all children. Working
from home has shown to allow for better productivity as people are able to work flexibly around their families.

Sending children back to school before they had the chance to be adequately vaccinated was not only a mistake but
a complete failure on the governing body’s behalf. Children were used as a means to get adults back to the
workplace. Something that studies have shown is not any more beneficial productivity wise.^^^^my children have
now had covid from the school system. My youngest now
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^■Neither of my children are eligible for a booster. Something that goes against what
many other countries are doing. Children have not been protected and I look forward to the day the government is
sued for this negligence.

Good luck with your inquiry.
