To Whom it may concern



Re: COVID-19 pandemic response inquiry



I am writing to express my deep concerns about several aspects of the government's handling
of the COVID-19 pandemic. While I acknowledge the challenges faced, there are critical issues
that demand attention.

Firstly, the allocation of $8 billion to Big Pharma for gene-vaccines without proper testing is
disconcerting, especially when considering the potential conflict of interest involving^^|
          chair of CEPI, reviewing the procurement deal. Transparency and unbiased scrutiny in
such matters are paramount to uphold public trust.

Moreover, the mRNA vaccines' insufficient testing and lack of peer-reviewed data raise
questions about their safety and efficacy. It is essential that public health decisions are
grounded in thorough and transparent scientific processes.

The imposition of lockdowns, though intended to curb the virus, has raised concerns about their
impact on human rights and personal autonomy. The long-term consequences, particularly on
mental health, especially for children deprived of social interactions and schooling, warrant a
comprehensive evaluation of the measures' effectiveness and necessity.

Mandating vaccines without conclusive evidence of their effectiveness raises moral and ethical
concerns. Citizens deserve clarity and assurance regarding the safety and efficacy of mandated
vaccines.

Furthermore, the government's actions, coupled with misinformation, have strained relationships
among families and communities. A lack of transparency and accountability has contributed to
widespread distrust in the government's handling of the pandemic.

It is crucial for the government to acknowledge and address the public's concerns, as its role is
to serve the citizens, not overreach into their lives. The apparent relationship with
pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna should be scrutinized to ensure ethical
standards are maintained.

I urge you to consider these concerns seriously, fostering a transparent dialogue with the public
to rebuild trust and ensure that decisions affecting citizens' lives are based on rigorous evidence
and ethical principles going forward.

Sincerely,
