Urgent Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry
I wish to submit this document expressing my deep concern and disapproval regarding the handling of
the COVID-19 crisis by the Australian governments including Federal, States and Territories. As an
Australian citizen, father and grandfather who has contributed to society through years of hard work and
tax payments, I am compelled to voice my grievances and demand a thorough investigation into
government (Federal, State, and Territories) and its agencies and bureaucracies regarding their actions,
decisions and processes during this challenging period.

The Australian governments' (Federal State and Territories) responses to the COVID-19 pandemic has
had far-reaching and devastating consequences. Businesses have been decimated, families torn apart,
and the most vulnerable members of our society were left to pass away in isolation, deprived of the
comfort of their loved ones. The economic fallout, including the reckless printing of vast amounts of
money for the monetary business support fund, has only added to the turmoil.

I demand a Royal Commission for a Full investigation into the following:

1 .Vaccine acquisition details including exposure of secret contracts with Vaccine manufacturers

2. Legality and chain of command behind Vaccine mandates.

3. Full revelation of vaccine injury recording, statistics and compensation/restitution.

4. Official misinformation campaigns - including arrangements with mainstream media to propogate-
about vaccines being "safe and effective" and false claims of vaccines blocking transmission.

5. Gagging of qualified and experiences doctors and experts

6. AHPRA and ATAGI's censorship of doctors - intimidation of doctors to go against their training and
expertise in advising patients re Covid-19

It has been profoundly disheartening to observe our governments blindly adhering to the directives of
the World Health Organization (WHO) without conducting their own investigations. The health system
was left in the hands of bureaucrats, while doctors and scientists were muzzled, and illegal mandates
were enforced. Australians lost their jobs simply for exercising their fundamental human rights and
choosing not to undergo an experimental medical procedure.

This has been a very dark chapter in Australia's history and must be fully investigated, with incompetent,
illegal and fraudulent actions being exposed.

Australians cannot be ignored, and the government's apparent apathy towards all-cause mortality raises
serious questions about its commitment to the well-being of its citizens. We Australians are all fearful of
how this medical procedure will affect our health in the future.



The Australian public is no longer willing to accept the lies and propaganda disseminated by the
government and health officials. The demand for a royal commission is not merely a request; it is a
resounding call from the people who have witnessed the mismanagement and disregard for public
welfare. An inquiry conducted without proper notice or transparency is insufficient to address the
magnitude of the grievances we, as Australians, harbor.



Therefore, I, along with countless others, implore the Australian Federal government to initiate a Royal
Commission to thoroughly investigate its (Federal, State and Territories) actions and that of it's agencies
during the COVID-19 crisis. We demand transparency, accountability, and justice for the lives disrupted
and lost during this tumultuous period.

Sincerely,

Royden Rogers
