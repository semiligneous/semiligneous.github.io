Submission to the SARS2 Response Inquiry

To the Members of the Independent Panel,

I am writing this submission to voice concerns over certain aspects of Australia's response to the
SARS2 pandemic. While I recognise the importance of the Inquiry's goal to improve pandemic
preparedness, there are critical areas that require thorough scrutiny.


Concerns Over Specific Pandemic Measures

Mask and Vaccine Mandates: The implementation of mask and vaccine mandates had significant
impacts on individual freedoms and social dynamics. These measures, often invasive, warrant a
detailed review to assess their necessity, effectiveness, and proportionality.

Lockdowns and Curfews: The economic, social, and psychological impacts of lockdowns and
curfews have been profound. An evaluation of these measures is essential to understand their
long-term effects on Australian society and whether they were the most appropriate response.

Communication Strategies: It is quite clear that there was an unwarranted use of fear and
psychological manipulation in public health messaging. It's important to analyse whether such
communication strategies were effective or whether they contributed to unnecessary panic and
distress among the public.

Mass experimentation on Citizens in the guise of public health and safety: The federal health
minister and prime minister colluded with pharmaceutical companies to experiment, Greg Hunt
calling it “the worlds largest clinical trial”, on the Australian public while giving full indemnity
of liability to the pharmaceutical companies and refusing to allow actual informed consent in
regards to the injectable “therapies” that were not fit for purpose. All procurement contracts
made with the pharmaceutical companies should be made available to the Australian public
without redaction. Your inquiry should also included why safe and effective, and possibly life
saving, medications were demonised and refused to the Australian public.


Concerns Over the Composition and Scope of the Inquiry

Panel Composition: The appointment of Inquiry panel members who have previously expressed
support for certain pandemic measures raises questions about the objectivity and impartiality of
the Inquiry. Panel members who have expressed support for such measures should recuse
themselves.

Exclusion of Unilateral State and Territory Government Decisions: One of the most significant
omissions in the Inquiry's scope is the exclusion of actions taken unilaterally by state and
territory governments. These decisions, including state-imposed lockdowns and border controls,
were pivotal to the nation's pandemic response and should be included in the Inquiry.
The Need for a Comprehensive Review

While the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry are extensive, it is crucial that the above­
mentioned areas are not overlooked. A truly comprehensive review should encompass all aspects
of the government's response, including those currently outside the Inquiry's scope.


Conclusion

This submission represents a collective call for a more inclusive and thorough investigation into
Australia's SARS2 response. It also urges for freedom and liberty to not ever be cast aside with
fear-mongering as it was by Australian governments during the pandemic. We urge the Inquiry
to consider these points to ensure transparency, accountability, and the safeguarding of
Australian values and liberties.
