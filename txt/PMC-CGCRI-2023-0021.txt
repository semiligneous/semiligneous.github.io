Submission to Covid 19 Enquiry

My name is Morny Cochrane and I live in Melbourne. I have three adult
sons. This submission refers to the Covid Restrictions' impact on our entire
family: one of complete and lifelong devastation.

My middle son ^^^^|was working with the^^fin                 as the
                           With lock downs and workin^rom home
became severely depressed and took his own life in December 2021. His
body was found hanging in his apartment three weeks later, with us being
notified on January 10th 2022.

We were aware of his condition but my attempts to gain permission to go to
        were unheard. We were unable to get information from^^H from
the Red Cross (for privacy reasons], from his doctor (same reason] and he
gradually cut off all his friends. He was unable to travel to Australia for the
same reason and as his communication ceased with us our desperation
escalated but literally no one would take my concerns seriously.

After^^^Jbody was found the worldwide ^^Hwere utterly shell shocked
and bewildered by his action. He was well loved, extremely competent at
his role and well known in many countries for his humanitarian
commitment, his courage and his sense of humour. The world is poorer for
his absence.

^^|and his wife were separated but lived within view of each other's
apartments so as to care for their beautiful son         It was^^^J
who raised the alarm that something wasn't right after she returned from
her Christmas holidays and realised his car hadn't moved.

Nothing can help our situation I know. I will never come to terms with this
senseless loss, and probably never forgive those for whom "Privacy issues"
over road plain common sense. Some at the          have been able to admit
they could have done more. No one expects someone of           calibre,
intelligence, recognition and talent to commit suicide.
My decision to share this pain with you is to make sure there is always an
avenue in the future for travel to be allowed in these urgent circumstances.
Mental health is now so much part of daily life but my calls to anywhere I
could think of brought me no avenue. I was told several times that I needed
information from^^J medical people. How on earth was I able to get
that? His medical practitioner and his superiors at       all refused me
information on ^^^^tatus.

He died alone and no one knew for three weeks!!

As^^^Jmother I am proud of the work he did, of the difference he made
to so many lives, of the man he was, the father he was and the son and
brother he was.

Pride doesn't fill the void, nor does time seem to ease the guilt I live with
that we somehow allowed this tragedy to happen.

Please, as you review Australia's covid strategy do not forget the^^^Hwe
ignored and lost.

Thank you for your time,

Yours sincerely,

Morny Cochrane
