            Submission to the COVID-19 Response Inquiry
              To the Members of the Independent Panel,



 I urge Members of the Independent Panel to learn about the evident
  harm caused by medical interventions and restrictions imposed in
response to the COVID pandemic provided in this submission and the
                        links I’m submitting.


Our own personal and national interest must guide all future
healthresponses. Australia should not fall sway to the WHO. Funding to the
WHO should discontinue. It was bad that the Australia’s last pandemic
response plan founded on 100 years of pandemic experience tailored to
the Australian context was thrown out in 2020 as explained here:




The result from the COVID pandemic response was excess deaths.
There is evidence in the NZ data that “In this LARGE whole population
dataset, mortality skyrockets for 6 months or more after the shot. It does
not do this in any large population which has not been given COVID
shots.”( https://kirschsubstack.com/p/kim-dotcom-discusses-my-new-
zealand?utm source=profile&utm medium=reader2 ) Therefore take
vaccinations off the market. There has never been any evidence that
vaccines stop infection or spread of any virus. Nor is there any evidence
that vaccines of any description reduce hospitalization or death. Vaccines
have been pulled for far less than this as explained here:

We have seen mortality rise after EACH dose. THIS IS
UNPRECEDENTED. Please read: https://kirschsubstack.com/p/my-email-

The pandemic agencies should be overhauled so that they operate in the
interests of the Australian people not globalist profiteers. Nutritional
medicine and nutritional immunology should be recommended in future



Russel Broadbent and other Senators have received numerous
notifications from constituents that have been vaccine injured. The US
government has tacitly admitted that the COVID vaccine has damaged the
hearts of many American pilots and should therefore be taken off the
market. Please read: https://kirschsubstack.com/p/the-faa-has-very-quietly-
tacitly The side effects of COVID vaccines are evident and no
pharmaceutical intervention should be marketed or mandated in Australia
without proof the product will do what it is marketed as doing.
In future cost risk analysis should be done before intervening in the
Australia’s economy. In any future pandemic response I recommend to not
permit lockdowns and restrictions on movement because they violate
human freedom, rights and dignity in violation of the Nuremberg code.
I advocate for these policy recommendations:

Be aware that Australians have not agreed to any of the policies of the
COVID pandemic response. For those making decisions about other
people’s health and bodies other than their own, there will be
consequences. Pharmaceutical companies forced a commercial agreement
on the people without plebiscite, without mandate (mandate comes from
latin meaning “We all agree”). We did not all agree and we deserve a
comprehensive COVID inquiry that looks into all the aspects of how the
pandemic was handled.
Giving $8 billion to big pharma for poorly tested gene-vaccines, without
industry standard testing requirements being met in deals that might
indicate a conflict of interest is one procedural inadequacy that should be
investigated and not be done again. The Halton review^^^^ links are

Many people were discriminated against for not being injected. The
government failed to introduce anti-discrimination legislation like the
following bills that failed to pass:

There is room for improvement with regard to any future pandemic
responses. Please attend to these ten matters.
